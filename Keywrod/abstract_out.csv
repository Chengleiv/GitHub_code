"AB  - We prepared to investigate the association of four well-defined polymorphisms in   the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) gene with the changes of   fasting blood soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) and the  risk for impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) in 1704 patients with primary  hypertension, aiming to infer possible causality between sRAGE/esRAGE and IGM.  This was a hospital-based case-control study, including 848 patients coexisting  with IGM (the case group) and 856 patients with normal glucose tolerance (the  control group). Fasting blood sRAGE and esRAGE concentrations were measured in  300 cases and 300 controls. There were significant differences in the  genotypes/alleles of T-429C (rs1800625) and T-374A (rs1800624) polymorphisms  between the case and control groups after Bonferroni correction (P<0.05/8).  Adjusted estimates of above two polymorphisms for IGM risk were remarkably  significant, especially under the recessive model (odd ratio [OR], 95% confidence  interval [CI], P: 3.57, 1.95-5.18, 0.002 for T-429C and 3.49, 1.42-8.58, 0.007  for T-374A). Mean sRAGE and esRAGE concentrations were significantly higher in  controls than in cases (P<0.001). Participants with the rs1800625 -429CC and  -429TC genotypes had significantly lower sRAGE (417.3 and 473.6 vs. 502.3pg/mL,  P<0.01) and esRAGE (230.1 and 298.0 vs. 340.4pg/mL, P<0.05) concentrations than  those with the -429TT genotype in primary hypertensive patients with IGM. Further  Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that per 100pg/mL reduction in fasting   blood sRAGE and esRAGE was causally associated with 2.40-fold (95% CI: 1.46-3.94)  and 2.65-fold (95% CI: 1.24-5.13) increased IGM risk, respectively. Our findings   collectively demonstrate that fasting blood sRAGE and esRAGE may be causally  implicated in IGM in primary hypertensive patients."|"igm,esrage,srage,polymorphisms,blood"|"esrage,igm,srage,patients,95" 
"AB  - The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism typically requires at least one  confirmatory test. The fludrocortisone suppression test is generally accepted as   a reliable confirmatory test, but it is cumbersome. Evidence from accuracy  studies of the saline infusion test (SIT) and the captopril challenge test (CCT)   has provided conflicting results. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the  diagnostic accuracy of the SIT and CCT using fludrocortisone suppression test as   the reference standard. One hundred thirty-five patients diagnosed with primary  aldosteronism and 101 patients diagnosed with essential hypertension who  completed the 3 confirmatory tests were included for the diagnostic accuracy  analysis. The areas under the receiver-operator characteristics curves of the CCT  and SIT were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-0.98) and 0.96 (95% CI,  0.92-0.98), respectively, using post-test plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC)   for diagnosis. However, the areas under the receiver-operator characteristics  curves of the CCT decreased to 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.77) when the PAC suppression   percentage was used to diagnose primary aldosteronism. The optimal cutoff of PAC   post-CCT was set at 11 ng/dL, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.90 (95% CI,  0.84-0.95) and a specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95), which were not  significantly different from those of SIT (with PAC post-SIT set at 8 ng/dL,  sensitivity: 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.91], P=0.192; specificity: 0.92 [95% CI,  0.85-0.97], P=0.551). In conclusion, both CCT and SIT are accurate alternatives  to the more complex fludrocortisone suppression test. Because CCT is safe and  much easier to perform, it may serve as a more feasible alternative. When  interpreting the results of CCT, PAC post-CCT is highly recommended."|"cct,test,sit,pac,suppression"|"95,cct,test,ci,sit" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between environmental exposure of non-smokers to  cigarette smoke and the coronary artery calcium scores has not been sufficiently   documented. The aim of the study was to identify the relationship between  environmental exposure to cigarette smoke and the risk of coronary artery disease  (CAD) estimated non-invasively through measurement of coronary artery calcium  score by computed tomography in patients with essential hypertension. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 67 patients with essential hypertension,   non-smokers environmentally exposed to cigarette smoke (group A) and on 67  patients with essential hypertension, non-smokers not exposed to cigarette smoke   (group B), selected using the case to case. Environmental exposure to cigarette  smoke was evaluated using a questionnaire. The risk of development of coronary  artery disease was estimated non-invasively through measurement of coronary  artery calcium score (CACS) by computed tomography. RESULTS: Group A was  characterised by significantly higher CACS and left anterior descending (LADCS)  calcium scores than group B. Compared to group B, group A had significantly  higher percentage of patients with significant risk of CAD estimated on the basis  of CACS values, and significantly lower percentage of patients with practically  no risk of CAD estimated with the same method. Advanced age, peripheral artery  diseases and environmental exposure to cigarette smoke are independent risk  factors associated with increased CACS and LADCS values. In addition, higher BMI   and hypercholesterolemia are independent risk factors for increased values of  LADCS. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with essential hypertension environmental  exposure to cigarette smoke may result in elevated risk of coronary artery  disease estimated non-invasively through measurement of coronary artery calcium  score by computed tomography."|"risk,smoke,patients,artery,cigarette"|"artery,cigarette,coronary,risk,smoke" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension (EH) is influenced by various environmental  and genetic factors. Nitric oxide is important for the functional integrity of  the vascular endothelium and is produced in endothelial cells by the enzyme  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). EH has a strong genetic component, and   the NOS3 gene, which encodes eNOS, represents an interesting candidate for  contribution to the phenotype. The most clinically relevant polymorphisms in the   NOS3 gene are rs1799983 in exon 7 (encoding Glu298Asp), a variable number tandem   repeat (VNTR) in intron 4, and rs2070744 (T-786C) in the promoter region. This  study aims to investigate the association between these three polymorphisms in  the NOS3 gene and EH in Sudanese patients. METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n =  157) > 18 years of age with established hypertension from various hospitals in  Khartoum, and controls (n = 85) > 18 years of age and with blood pressure  measurements <140/90, were included in this case control study. Genotypes at the   NOS3 variants were determined using TaqMan and polymerase chain reaction  restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses. Genotype and allele  frequencies were compared between the two groups by chi(2) analysis, and  differences were expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). P   values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The rs2070744  polymorphism in NOS3 was found to be associated with EH in the Sudanese  population as the patients group had higher frequency of CC genotype compared  with the controls (6.6% vs 6.1%, p = 0.02). Considering a dominant inheritance  model, the frequency of TC + CC genotypes in patients was significantly higher  than that in the control subjects (52.6% vs 34.1%, respectively; p < 0.01), with   an odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.14 (1.23-3.74). In addition, the C allele was more  frequent in the patients than the control group (29.6% vs 20%, p = 0.03, OR =  1.84 (1.15-2.93)). The c allele of intron 4 VNTR was reported in >1% of the  Sudanese population under study. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated   that the rs2070744 polymorphism in NOS3 may be a genetic susceptibility factor  for EH in the Sudanese population. The c allele of intron 4 VNTR is not rare in  the Sudanese population."|"nos3,eh,patients,study,sudanese"|"nos3,eh,patients,sudanese,allele" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to search for metabolic biomarkers of antihypertensive drug  responsiveness, we measured >600 biochemicals in plasma samples of subjects  participating in the GENRES Study. Hypertensive men received in a double-blind  rotational fashion amlodipine, bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide and losartan, each  as a monotherapy for one month, with intervening one-month placebo cycles.  METHODS: Metabolomic analysis was carried out using ultra high performance liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Full metabolomic signatures (the drug  cycles and the mean of the 3 placebo cycles) became available in 38 to 42  patients for each drug. Blood pressure was monitored by 24-h recordings. RESULTS:  Amlodipine (P values down to 0.002), bisoprolol (P values down to 2 x 10-5) and  losartan (P values down to 2 x 10-4) consistently decreased the circulating  levels of long-chain acylcarnitines. Bisoprolol tended to decrease (P values down  to 0.002) the levels of several medium- and long-chain fatty acids.  Hydrochlorothiazide administration was associated with an increase of plasma uric  acid level (P = 5 x 10-4) and urea cycle metabolites. Decreases of both systolic   (P = 0.06) and diastolic (P = 0.04) blood pressure after amlodipine  administration tended to associate with a decrease of plasma hexadecanedioate, a   dicarboxylic fatty acid recently linked to blood pressure regulation.  CONCLUSIONS: Although this systematic metabolomics study failed to identify  circulating metabolites convincingly predicting favorable antihypertensive  response to four different drug classes, it provided accumulating evidence  linking fatty acid metabolism to human hypertension."|"drug,fatty,acid,plasma,amlodipine"|"drug,values,10,acid,amlodipine" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are commonly used to estimate the presence of subclinical   cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with essential arterial hypertension  (HT). In addition to known association between cystatin C and glomerular  filtration rate (GFR), elucidating the association between cystatin C and  vascular biomarkers (intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (CCIMT),  carotid plaque and renal artery resistance index (RRI)) in patients with  unresponsive hypertensive phenotype could be of significant clinical interest.  METHODS: Participants (n = 200, median age 58 (52-64) years, 49% female) under  treatment with antihypertensive drugs were stratified into two subgroups based on  their blood pressure level as having responsive hypertension (RHT - compliant and  responsive to treatment, n = 100), or nonresponsive (URHT - compliant but  nonresponsive to treatment, n = 100). GFR was measured by isotopic  (slope-intercept) method (99m Tc diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid - mGFR).  RESULTS: The URHT group had significantly higher median cystatin C serum  concentration (p = 0.02) and CCIMT (p = 0.00) compared to the RHT group, with no   significant difference in RRI (p = 0.51) and mGFR among subgroups [69.9 +/- 28.2   vs 76.74 +/- 23.61 ml/min/1.73m(2), p = 0.27]. In the URHT group, cystatin C was   found to be associated with CCIMT (p = 0.02), hsCRP (p = 0.01) and duration of HT  (p = 0.02), independently of mGFR and age. Independent predictors of URHT  phenotype were CCIMT (p= 0.02) and hsCRP (p= 0.04). CONCLUSION: In addition to  GFR, cystatin C serum concentration is positively and independently associated  with CCIMT in patient with URHT phenotype and subclinical CVD. Prospective larger  studies should further investigate the clinical importance of this relationship."|"urht,ccimt,cystatin,gfr,mgfr"|"ccimt,cystatin,urht,02,gfr" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension and atherosclerosis though separate entities, are  interrelated as hypertension plays an important role in the pathogenesis of  atherosclerosis. This study was undertaken to study the association of carotid  intimal medial thickness with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive   patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hundred hypertensives (JNC-7, Stage 1 and 2)  between 30 and 55 years were enrolled in this prospective observational study  conducted at a tertiary care teaching institute of Punjab, India.  Electrocardiogram, Carotid Doppler, and Echocardiography were carried out in  addition to routine biochemical investigations. RESULTS: Increased carotid  intimal medial thickness (CIMT) had statistically significant association with  age, duration of hypertension, high systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP),  left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular mass index but was not  associated with body mass index, low-density lipoproteins, and total cholesterol.  CONCLUSIONS: LVH and arterial wall changes occur concurrently, and therefore,  management of hypertension should not be limited just to control of BP but should  also include therapy for carotid plaques and increased CIMT."|"hypertension,carotid,study,ventricular,left"|"carotid,hypertension,left,study,ventricular" 
"AB  - AIMS: Essential hypertension (EH) is a disease in which both environment and  genes have an important role. This study was designed to identify the interaction  model between genetic variants and environmental risk factors that most highly  potentiates EH development. METHODS: We performed a case-control study with 1641   participants (mean age 50.6 +/- 8.1 years), specifically 848 patients with EH and  793 controls, adjusted for gender and age. Traditional risk factors, biochemical   and genetic parameters, including the genotypic discrimination of 14 genetic  variants previously associated with EH, were investigated. Multifactorial  dimensionality reduction (MDR) software was used to analyze gene-environment  interactions. Validation was performed using logistic regression analysis with  environmental risk factors, significant genetic variants, and the best MDR model.  RESULTS: The best model indicates that the interactions among the ADD1 rs4961  640T allele, diabetes, and obesity (body mass index >/=30) increase approximately  four-fold the risk of EH (odds ratio = 3.725; 95% confidence interval:  2.945-4.711; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This work showed that the interaction  between the ADD1 rs4961 variant, obesity, and the presence of diabetes increased   the susceptibility to EH four-fold. In these circumstances, lifestyle adjustment   and diabetes control should be intensified in patients who carry the ADD1  variant."|"eh,risk,diabetes,genetic,add1"|"eh,genetic,risk,add1,diabetes" 
"AB  - Purpose - to improve antihypertensive therapy on the basis of studying the  antioxidant properties of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  (fosinopril sodium) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), their impact on  endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory cytokines activity in hypertensive  patients with overweight and obesity. A combination of fosinopril sodium 20  mg/day and hydrochlorothiazid 12.5 mg/day was prescribed to 54 patients with  essential hypertension of 1-3 grades, 30 to 65 years old . The control group  included 10 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. During the course of  combined antihypertensive therapy we observed a significant decrease of i-NOS  activity, reduce of TNF-alpha type I of its soluble receptor (sTNF-alphaRI), and   8-iso-PgF2alpha in the patients. Activity of e-NOS, superoxide dismutase and  catalase, in contrast, were increased in patients with hypertension and  concomitant obesity. Thus, the improvement of endothelial function, a significant  decrease autoimmune activation due to lower tension of oxidative stress in the  examined patients optimizes use of a combination of fosinopril sodium and  hydrochlorothiazid for differentiated therapy in hypertensive patients with  obesity."|"patients,activity,therapy,fosinopril,sodium"|"patients,activity,fosinopril,obesity,sodium" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a complex disease in which physiological,  environmental, and genetic factors are involved in its genesis. The genetic  variant of the alpha-adducin gene (ADD1) has been described as a risk factor for   EH, but with controversial results.The objective of this study was to evaluate  the association of ADD1 (Gly460Trp) gene polymorphism with the EH risk in a  population from Madeira Island.A case-control study with 1614 individuals of  Caucasian origin was performed, including 817 individuals with EH and 797  controls. Cases and controls were matched for sex and age, by frequency-matching   method. All participants collected blood for biochemical and genotypic analysis  for the Gly460Trp polymorphism. We further investigated which variables were  independently associated to EH, and, consequently, analyzed their interactions.In  our study, we found a significant association between the ADD1 gene polymorphism   and EH (odds ratio 2.484, P = .01). This association remained statistically  significant after the multivariate analysis (odds ratio 2.548, P = .02).The ADD1   Gly460Trp gene polymorphism is significantly and independently associated with EH  risk in our population. The knowledge of genetic polymorphisms associated with EH  is of paramount importance because it leads to a better understanding of the  etiology and pathophysiology of this pathology.

"AB  - Inflammation has been shown to play an important role in the mechanisms involved   in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Connexins (Cxs)-based gap junction channels   (GJCs) or hemichannels (HCs) are involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in  the immune system. However, the role of Cx43-based channels in T-lymphocytes in  mediating the immune response in essential hypertension is not fully understand.   The present study was designed to investigate the role of Cxs-based channels in T  lymphocytes in the regulation of hypertension-mediated inflammation. The surface   expressions of T lymphocyte subtypes, Cx40/Cx43, and inflammatory cytokines  (IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma) and TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor alpha)) in T  cells, as well as gap junction communication of peripheral blood lymphocytes from  essential hypertensive patients (EHs) and normotensive healthy subjects (NTs)  were detected by flow cytometry. Expression levels and phosphorylation of Cx43  protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes of EHs and NTs were analyzed by Western  blot. The proliferation rate of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after   treatment with a Cxs inhibitor was examined by a CCK-8 assay. The levels of  inflammatory cytokines were detected using ELISA. Within the CD3+ T cell subsets,  we found a significant trend toward an increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cells  and CD4+/CD8+ ratio as well as in serum levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-a in the  peripheral blood of EHs compared with those in NTs. Moreover, the peripheral  blood lymphocytes of EH patients exhibited enhanced GJCs formation, increased  Cx43 protein level and Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser368, and a significant increase  in Cx40/Cx43 surface expressions levels in CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes. Cx43-based  channel inhibition by a mimetic peptide greatly reduced the exchange of dye  between lymphocytes, proliferation of stimulated lymphocytes and the  pro-inflammatory cytokine levels of EHs and NTs. Our data suggest that  Cx40/Cx43-based channels in lymphocytes may be involved in the regulation of T  lymphocyte proliferation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which   contribute to the hypertensive inflammatory response."|"lymphocytes,cx43,levels,blood,based"|"lymphocytes,cx43,based,blood,inflammatory" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience  complex functional and structural changes of the cardiopulmonary and  musculoskeletal system. This results in reduced exercise tolerance, quality of  life and ultimately premature death. We investigated the relationship between  subjective measures of health related quality of life and objective, standardised  functional measures for cardiovascular and pulmonary health. METHODS: Between  April 2010 and January 2013, 143 CKD stage-5 or CKD5d patients (age 46.0+/-1.1y,   62.2% male), were recruited prospectively. A control group of 83 healthy  individuals treated for essential hypertension (HTN; age 53.2+/-0.9y, 48.22%  male) were recruited at random. All patients completed the SF-36 health survey  questionnaire, echocardiography, vascular tonometry and cardiopulmonary exercise   testing. RESULTS: Patients with CKD had significantly lower SF-36 scores than the  HTN group; for physical component score (PCS; 45.0 vs 53.9, p<0.001) and mental  component score (MCS; 46.9 vs. 54.9, p<0.001). CKD subjects had significantly  poorer exercise tolerance and cardiorespiratory performance compared with HTN  (maximal oxygen uptake; VO2peak 19.9 vs 25.0ml/kg/min, p<0.001). VO2peak was a  significant independent predictor of PCS in both groups (CKD: b = 0.35, p = 0.02   vs HTN: b = 0.27, p = 0.001). No associations were noted between PCS scores and  echocardiographic characteristics, vascular elasticity and cardiac biomarkers in   either group. No associations were noted between MCS and any variable. The  interaction effect of study group with VO2peak on PCS was not significant (DeltaB  = 0.08; 95%CI -0.28-0.45, p = 0.7). However, overall for a given VO2peak, the  measured PCS was much lower for patients with CKD than for HTN cohort, a likely  consequence of systemic uremia effects. CONCLUSION: In CKD and HTN, objective  physical performance has a significant effect on quality of life; particularly  self-reported physical health and functioning. Therefore, these quality of life  measures are indeed a good reflection of physical health correlating highly with   objective physical performance measures."|"ckd,health,htn,patients,pcs"|"ckd,htn,health,patients,pcs" 
"AB  - Low-frequency variants showed that there is more power to detect risk variants  than to detect protective variants in complex diseases. Aldosterone plays an  important role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and aldosterone  synthase catalyzes the speed-controlled steps of aldosterone biosynthesis.  Polymorphisms of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) have been reported to be  associated with essential hypertension (EH). CYP11B2 polymorphisms such as  -344T/C, have been extensively reported, but others are less well known. This  study aimed to assess the association between human CYP11B2 and EH using a  haplotype-based case-control study. A total of 1024 EH patients and 956  normotensive controls, which consist of north Han population peasants, were  enrolled. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs28659182, rs10087214,  rs73715282, rs542092383, rs4543, rs28491316, and rs7463212) covering the entire  human CYP11B2 gene were genotyped as markers using the MassARRAY system. The  major allele G frequency of rs542092383 was found to be risk against hypertension  [odds ratio (OR) 3.478, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.407-8.597, P = .004].   The AG genotype frequency of SNP rs542092383 was significantly associated with an  increased risk of hypertension (OR 4.513, 95% CI 1.426-14.287, P = .010). In the   haplotype-based case-control analysis, the frequency of the T-G-T haplotype was  higher for EH patients than for controls (OR 5.729, 95% CI 1.889-17.371, P =  .000495). All |D'| values of the seven SNPs were >0.9, and r values for  rs28659182- rs10087214-rs28491316-rs7463212 SNPs were >0.8 and showed strong  linkage intensity. Haplotype T-G-T may therefore be a useful genetic marker for  EH."|"eh,frequency,haplotype,aldosterone,cyp11b2"|"aldosterone,eh,95,cyp11b2,frequency" 
"AB  - This study aimed to test the effects of xuezhikang, a cholestin extract that  contains statin-like components, on arterial stiffness in patients with essential  hypertension. One hundred hypertensive patients from the Chinese PLA General  Hospital were randomly allocated to receive xuezhikang (1200 mg/day, orally) or  placebo (same capsules containing only pharmaceutical excipients). Physical  examination outcomes, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)  levels, matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) levels, and arterial outcomes,  including stiffness parameter (beta), pressure-strain elasticity modulus (Ep),  arterial compliance (AC), augmentation index (AI), and one-point pulse wave  velocity (PWVbeta) were obtained at baseline and after 6 months of the  intervention. Xuezhikang significantly reduced beta (8.4+/-3.1 vs 6.8+/-2.1,  P=0.007), Ep (122.8+/-43.9 vs 100.7+/-33.2, P=0.009), PWVbeta (6.7+/-1.2 vs  6.1+/-1.0, P=0.013), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.4+/-0.6 vs 2.9+/-0.5,  P=0.001), hs-CRP [2.1 (0.4-10.0) vs 1.4 (0.3-4.1), P=0.020], and MMP-9  (17.2+/-2.4 vs 12.7+/-3.8, P <0.001) compared to baseline. The placebo had no  effect on these parameters. The changes of PWVbeta in the xuezhikang group was  significantly associated with the changes of hs-CRP and MMP-9 (r=0.144, P=0.043;   r=0.278, P=0.030, respectively) but not with lipid profile changes. Our research   showed xuezhikang can improve the parameters of arterial stiffness in  hypertensive patients, and its effect was independent of lipid lowering."|"xuezhikang,arterial,stiffness,patients,pwvbeta"|"vs,xuezhikang,arterial,changes,crp" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: Intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering is important for the treatment of  hypertension; however, it has been a challenge to achieve target BP in many  patients. The purpose of this study was to explore the optimal dosage of a  fixed-dose combination of candesartan cilexetil (CAN) and amlodipine besylate  (AML), by examining the tolerability and efficacy of CAN/AML combination therapy   compared with those of monotherapy with either drug in patients with essential  hypertension. METHODS: This Phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blind  clinical trial enrolled patients aged 19 years or older with essential  hypertension, defined as a mean sitting diastolic BP (msDBP) between 95 and 115  mm Hg, and a mean sitting systolic BP (msSBP) of <200 mm Hg after a 2-week  placebo run-in period. A total of 635 patients were screened, of whom 439 were  randomized to receive treatment; 425 patients were included in the full analysis   set (combination therapy, 212; monotherapy, 213). Participants were randomly  assigned to receive 1 of 8 treatments: CAN (8 or 16 mg), AML (5 or 10 mg),  CAN/AML (8 mg/5 mg, 8 mg/10 mg, 16 mg/5 mg, or 16 mg/10 mg), once daily for 8  weeks. FINDINGS: After 8 weeks of treatment, changes in msDBP were significantly   greater in the groups receiving CAN/AML combination therapies compared with  monotherapies at matched doses, with the exception of CAN 8 mg/AML 10 mg versus  AML 10 mg. The response to treatment and the achievement of target BP (both msSBP  and msDBP) at week 8 were significantly greater overall in the groups that  received combination therapy versus monotherapy. All medications were relatively   well tolerated in each group. IMPLICATIONS: Eight-week administration of CAN/AML   (8 mg/5 mg, 16 mg/5 mg, and 16 mg/10 mg) resulted in a significantly greater BP  reduction than that with CAN or AML monotherapy, and was determined to be well  tolerated.

"AB  - INTRODUCTION: The mammalian SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich serine-threonine  kinase SPAK (STK39) modulates ion transport across and between epithelial cells  in response to environmental stimuli such osmotic stress and inflammation.  Research over the last decade has established a central role for SPAK in the  regulation of ion and water transport in the distal nephron, colonic crypts, and   pancreatic ducts, and has implicated deregulated SPAK signaling in NaCl-sensitive  hypertension, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and cystic fibrosis. Areas   covered: We review recent advances in our understanding of the role of SPAK  kinase in the regulation of epithelial transport. We highlight how SPAK signaling  - including its upstream Cl(-) sensitive activators, the WNK kinases, and its  downstream ion transport targets, the cation- Cl(-) cotransporters contribute to   human disease. We discuss prospects for the pharmacotherapeutic targeting of SPAK  kinase in specific human disorders that feature impaired epithelial homeostasis.   Expert opinion: The development of novel drugs that antagonize the SPAK-WNK  interaction, inhibit SPAK kinase activity, or disrupt SPAK kinase activation by  interfering with its binding to MO25alpha/beta could be useful adjuncts in  essential hypertension, inflammatory colitis, and cystic fibrosis."|"spak,kinase,transport,ion,epithelial"|"spak,kinase,transport,epithelial,ion" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to understand the effects of single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in UGT1A1, SLCO1B3, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, and ORM1 on the  pharmacokinetics (PK) (plasma concentration) and pharmacodynamics (PD) (blood  pressure) of telmisartan in Chinese patients. METHODS: 58 Han Chinese patients  (aged 45 - 72 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were included  and received 80 mg/day telmisartan for 4 weeks. The plasma concentration and  genetic variants were determined by LC/MS/MS and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry,  respectively. Multivariable linear analysis was used to examine the relationships  between PK/PD and genetic variants. RESULTS: Females showed a significantly  higher AUC<sub>last</sub> than males (n = 22, 4,879.48 +/- 3,449.33 hxng/mL vs. n  = 36, 2,715.59 +/- 2,223.77 hxng/mL, p = 0.047). Amongst all genetic variants  investigated, the patients with UGT1A1 rs4124874 AA (n = 11, 1,730.51 +/-  1,325.79 hxng/mL) had a significantly lower AUC<sub>last</sub> compared with  patients with UGT1A1 rs4124874 CC+AC (n = 19 + 28, 4,177.44 +/- 3,222.11 hxng/mL   and 3,810.82 +/- 2,960.43 hxng/mL, p = 0.027). None of the SNPs investigated was   associated with the PD responses to telmisartan. CONCLUSION: Variation of UGT1A1   (rs4124874) affects PK of telmisartan in Chinese patients, highlighting the value  of genetic testing in precision medicine as the telmisartan dose could be  adjusted based on UGT1A1 genetic variations.."|"telmisartan,genetic,ugt1a1,patients,pk"|"genetic,hxng,ml,patients,telmisartan" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The age-related increase in pulse pressure (PP) and systolic blood  pressure (SBP) is often attributed to alterations in the wave reflection profile   and augmented contributions of the reflected waves. However, clinical evidence  shows that the stiffening of the proximal aorta with age and the consequent  augmentation of the forward pressure wave plays an equally important role. The  relative importance of the forward and reflected wave components in essential  hypertension has not yet been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current  investigation was to simulate the major ageing mechanisms in the arterial system   and the heart using a mathematical one-dimensional model of the arterial tree and  to assess the evolution of systolic and pulse pressure during normal  (non-pathological) ageing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our state-of-the-art 1-D model  was extended to include turbulence and inertial effects of the flow exiting the  left ventricle. Literature data on the age-associated changes in arterial  stiffness, peripheral resistance and cardiac contractility were gathered and used  as an input for the simulations. The predicted evolution of pressure and  augmentation index with age followed accurately the curves obtained in a number  of large-scale clinical studies. Analysis of the relative contribution of the  forward and backward wave components showed that the forward wave becomes the  major determinant of the increase in central and peripheral SBP and PP with  advancing age. CONCLUSIONS: The 1-D model of the ageing tree and heart captures  faithfully and with great accuracy the central pressure evolution with ageing.  The stiffening of the proximal aorta and the resulting augmentation of the  forward pressure wave is the major contributor of the systolic pressure  augmentation with age."|"pressure,wave,age,ageing,forward"|"pressure,age,wave,forward,ageing" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) plays an  important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of essential hypertension  (EH). It has been suggested that polymorphisms of PPARG are associated with the  risk of EH. However, findings to date remain controversial. To elucidate the  associations between the PPARG Pro12Ala and C161T polymorphisms and EH risk, a  meta-analysis was carried out. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of  PubMed, Embase, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP and Wanfang  databases was conducted. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval  (CI) were calculated to estimate the size of the effect using the random-effects   model. At the same time, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%  CI was used for the meta-analysis of the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism and blood  pressure. RESULTS: Finally, Fifteen papers (seventeen studies) including 4,151  cases and 4,997 controls to evaluate the association of the PPARGPro12Ala  polymorphism and EH risk, were included in this study. Overall, the results  suggested that Ala allele was associated with the decreased EH risk (for allelic   model, OR = 0.757, 95%CI: 0.624-0.918, P = 0.005; for dominant model, OR = 0.771,  95%CI: 0.627-0.946, P = 0.013). The subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity  showed that the significant association between the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism  and EH was only detected in the Asian subgroup. There was no difference in blood   pressure values between Ala carriers and non-carriers. For the C161T  polymorphism, only 5 studies comprising 1,118 cases and 1,357 controls met the  inclusion criteria. The overall results showed that the PPARG C161T polymorphism   was not associated with the risk of EH. But in the subgroup analysis, we found  that the PPARG C161T polymorphism significantly associated with the risk of EH in  the Asian subgroup (for allelic model, OR = 0.719, 95% CI: 0.537-0.963, P =  0.027; for dominant model, OR = 0.653, 95% CI: 0.439-0.972, P = 0.036).  CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggested that the PPARG polymorphisms might be  associated with the risk of EH."|"pparg,eh,polymorphism,risk,analysis"|"eh,pparg,risk,95,ci" 
"AB  - Hypertension is associated with enhanced vascular oxidative stress and impaired  endothelial function, which is related to an imbalance between reactive oxygen  species and nitric oxide bioavailability. Short-term supplementation with a  polyphenol-rich powdered red wine pomace seasoning (RWPS) was investigated for  its effects on blood pressure and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and  oxidative status in a model of essential hypertension. Male spontaneously  hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (12-week-old, 5 rats   per group) were administered RWPS (300 mg kg(-1) day(-1); equivalent to 7.32 mg  gallic acid per kg per day) or vehicle by gavage. In SHRs, 4-week RWPS  supplementation progressively decreased blood pressure, reaching 11.5% reduction   at the end of the study (p < 0.001). RWPS consumption also increased the ferric  reducing ability of plasma and attenuated the oxidation of plasma lipids and  proteins, as evidenced by F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl  groups as oxidative stress biomarkers. Moreover, nitric oxide production  (indirectly measured) was 1.5-fold higher in SHRs + RWPS than that in SHRs (p <  0.05). These beneficial effects were partly attributed to the ability of  RWPS-derived bioactive compounds to modulate aortic gene expression, with eNOS,  SOD2 and HO-1 over-expression, ACE down-regulation, and no changes in NOX4. In  conclusion, this study suggests the potential of red wine pomace-derived  seasonings to help in the management of hypertension."|"rwps,shrs,oxidative,derived,ability"|"rwps,shrs,hypertension,oxidative,rats" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: This 4-month, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was designed  to demonstrate the superiority of perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine single pill  over perindopril/indapamide after 1 month and to determine further up-titration  efficacy and safety in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. METHODS:  After a 1-month run-in period on perindopril/indapamide 5/1.25 mg, patients with   SBP/DBP at least 150/95 mmHg and no diabetes or renal insufficiency received  perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine 5/1.25/5 mg single pill or continued on the  same treatment. At 1, 2, and 3 months, patients with uncontrolled blood pressure   (SBP/DBP >/= 140/90 mmHg) were gradually up-titrated with a higher dose of the  triple therapy up to perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine 10/2.5/10 mg in both  groups. Efficacy was assessed on office supine SBP (main criterion) and DBP,  blood pressure control, and response rates. Treatment effect on ambulatory blood   pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) parameters  was also assessed in two subpopulations of 276 and 263 patients, respectively.  RESULTS: A total of 454 hypertensive patients (diabetes and renal insufficiency  excluded) were randomized, 227 to each group (56% were men, mean age was 55  years, blood pressure 162.3/101.1 mmHg). After 1 month, superior SBP (-3.1 mmHg,   P = 0.02) and DBP (-2.8 mmHg, P < 0.001) reductions were observed with  perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine, which were even more pronounced after  excluding white-coat effect in the sustained hypertension population (-5.3/-3.7  mmHg). Similar results were observed in terms of blood pressure response (72 vs.   53%, P < 0.0001) and control rates (32 vs. 25%, P = 0.005). Up-titration was  effective at each visit in both treatment arms (P < 0.001). Both ABPM and HBPM  results confirmed the superiority of the triple therapy at 1 month on ASBP/ADBP  and HSBP/HDBP: -4.5/-2.0 mmHg for ABPM (P < 0.001/P = 0.04), and -4.9/-3.1 mmHg  for HBPM (both, P < 0.001). Up-titration steps resulted in further significant  decreases in both ABPM and HBPM. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated  regarding adverse events or laboratory testing. In particular, peripheral edema  known to be amlodipine dose dependent, appeared in only a few cases, none with  the highest dose. Hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and cough whatever the  dose were infrequent. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events.  CONCLUSION: Perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine in a single pill produces superior   reductions in blood pressure compared with dual therapy. Triple therapy  up-titration was well tolerated and effective leading to BP control rates of over  80%. Analysis of 24-h ABPM and HBPM results corroborated these findings."|"blood,pressure,treatment,perindopril,month"|"mmhg,blood,indapamide,perindopril,pressure" 
"AB  - In both humans and animals, essential hypertension acts as a risk factor for  subclinical kidney damage and precedes renal dysfunction. Several lines of  evidence indicate that hypertension and oxidative stress are closely related. The  increase in vascular oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathophysiological   consequences of hypertension, including kidney disease. Our study examined this  issue in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a reliable model of essential  hypertension. We used SHR 20 weeks old when hypertension is stably developed,  vascular remodeling started, but kidney function is preserved. We examined  plasmatic pro-oxidant and antioxidant status showing a significant alteration in   oxidative balance in SHR. As index of oxidative damage, we evaluated lipid  peroxidation in kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, detecting a significant rise   in lipid peroxidation levels in all SHR tissues, particularly relevant in kidney.  In addition, we analyzed the expression of cytoplasmic antioxidant enzymes,  superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutatione S-tranferasi P1 (GSTP1). In SHR  liver, SOD1 expression slight increased while we have not detected any variation   in other tissues. Concerning GSTP1, SHR renal tissues did not display variations   in enzyme expression, while in the other tissues, we observed a significant  increase in both monomeric and pro-apoptotic dimeric form of the enzyme. By  analyzing apoptotic signal, we founded c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation  in all SHR tissues, but only kidney presented extrinsic apoptotic pathway  activation. Our results suggest that, in hypertensive animals with preserved  renal function, despite the remarkable oxidative damage of renal tissues, only  the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated."|"shr,kidney,hypertension,tissues,oxidative"|"shr,kidney,tissues,hypertension,oxidative" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis (AS) is an inflammatory disease. Inflammation was  considered to play a role in the whole process of AS. This study aimed to analyze  the relationships of inflammatory factors and risk factors with different target   organ damages (TOD) in essential hypertension (EH) patients and to explore its  clinical significance. METHODS: A total of 294 EH patients were selected and  divided into four groups according to their conditions of TOD. Forty-eight  healthy subjects were selected as control. The clinical biochemical parameters,  serum amyloid A, serum tryptase, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2  (Lp-PLA2) in each group were detected, and the related risk factors were also  statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Fibrinogen (Fbg) was the most significant  independent risk factor in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) group (odds ratio [OR]:   22.242, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.458-76.609, P< 0.001) with the largest  absolute value of the standardized partial regression coefficient B' (b': 1.079).  Lp-PLA2 was the most significant independent risk factor in stroke group (OR:  13.699, 95% CI: 5.236-35.837, P< 0.001) with b' = 0.708. Uric acid (UA) was the  most significant independent risk factor in renal damage group (OR: 15.307, 95%  CI: 4.022-58.250, P< 0.001) with b' = 1.026. CONCLUSIONS: Fbg, Lp-PLA2, and UA  are the strongest independent risk factors toward the occurrence of ACS, ischemic  stroke, and renal damage in EH patients, thus exhibiting the greatest impacts on   the occurrence of ACS, ischemic stroke, and renal damage in EH patients,  respectively."|"risk,factors,patients,eh,independent"|"risk,eh,factors,group,independent" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the gain and latency of arterial   baroreflex control of heart rate in patients with resistant hypertension compared  to patients with essential hypertension and normotensive subjects. METHODS:  Eighteen patients with resistant hypertension (56 +/- 10 years, mean of four  antihypertensive drugs), 17 patients with essential hypertension (56 +/- 11  years, mean of two antihypertensive drugs), and 17 untreated normotensive  controls (50 +/- 15 years) were evaluated by spectral analysis of the spontaneous  fluctuations of arterial pressure (beat-to-beat) and heart rate (ECG). This  analysis estimated vasomotor and cardiac autonomic modulations, respectively. The  transfer function analysis quantified the gain and latency of the response of  output signal (RR interval) per unit of spontaneous change of input signal  (systolic arterial pressure). RESULTS: The gain was similarly lower in patients  with resistant hypertension and patients with essential hypertension in relation   to normotensive subjects (4.67 +/- 2.96 vs. 6.60 +/- 3.30 vs. 12.56 +/- 8.81  ms/mmHg; P < 0.01, respectively). However, the latency of arterial baroreflex  control of heart rate was significantly higher only in patients with resistant  hypertension when compared to patients with essential hypertension and  normotensive subjects (-4.01 +/- 3.19 vs. -2.91 +/- 2.10 vs. -1.82 +/- 1.09 s; P   = 0.04, respectively). In addition, the index of vasomotor sympathetic modulation  was significantly increased only in patients with resistant hypertension when  compared to patients with essential hypertension and normotensive subjects (4.04   +/- 2.86 vs. 2.65 +/- 1.88 vs. 2.06 +/- 1.70 mmHg(2); P < 0.01, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with resistant hypertension have reduced gain and increased  latency of arterial baroreflex control of heart rate. These patients also have  increased vasomotor sympathetic modulation."|"patients,hypertension,gain,arterial,analysis"|"patients,hypertension,resistant,vs,arterial" 
"AB  - Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcriptional  regulator of redox homeostasis that impacts antioxidant gene expression. Central   oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant enzyme expression in the rostral  ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) contributed to sympathoexcitation in chronic heart  failure. In the current study, we hypothesized that deletion of Nrf2 in the RVLM   would increase sympathetic drive and blood pressure. Experiments were performed  in Nrf2-floxed mice treated with microinjection of lentiviral-Cre-GFP or  lentiviral-GFP into the RVLM. Two weeks after viral administration, Nrf2 message,  protein, oxidative stress, cardiovascular function, and sympathetic outflow were   evaluated. We found that (1) Nrf2 mRNA and protein in the RVLM were significantly  lower in Cre mice compared with control GFP mice. Nrf2-targeted antioxidant  enzymes were downregulated, whereas reactive oxygen species were elevated. (2)  Blood pressure measurements indicated that Cre mice displayed a significant  increase in blood pressure (mean arterial pressure, 123.7+/-3.8 versus  100.2+/-2.2 mm Hg; P<0.05, n=6), elevated urinary norepinephrine (NE)  concentration (456.4+/-16.9 versus 356.5+/-19.9 ng/mL; P<0.05, n=6), and  decreased spontaneous baroreflex gain (up sequences, 1.66+/-0.17 versus  3.61+/-0.22 ms/mm Hg; P<0.05, n=6; down sequences, 1.89+/-0.12 versus 2.98+/-0.19  ms/mm Hg; P<0.05, n=6). (3) Cre mice displayed elevated baseline renal  sympathetic nerve activity and impaired inducible baroreflex function. These data  suggest that Nrf2 gene deletion in the RVLM elevates blood pressure, increases  sympathetic outflow, and impairs baroreflex function potentially by impaired  antioxidant enzyme expression."|"nrf2,rvlm,mice,pressure,sympathetic"|"nrf2,mice,pressure,rvlm,05" 
"AB  - The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), one of the most widely used model of  essential hypertension, is predisposed to left ventricular hypertrophy,  myocardial fibrosis, and metabolic disturbances. Recently, quantitative trait  loci influencing blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and heart interstitial  fibrosis were genetically isolated within a minimal congenic subline that  contains only 7 genes, including mutant Plzf (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger)  candidate gene. To identify Plzf as a quantitative trait gene, we targeted Plzf  in the SHR using the transcription activator-like effector nuclease technique and  obtained SHR line harboring targeted Plzf gene with a premature stop codon.  Because the Plzf targeted allele is semilethal, morphologically normal  heterozygous rats were used for metabolic and hemodynamic analyses. SHR-Plzf(+/-)  heterozygotes versus SHR wild-type controls exhibited reduced body weight and  relative weight of epididymal fat, lower serum and liver triglycerides and  cholesterol, and better glucose tolerance. In addition, SHR-Plzf(+/-) rats  exhibited significantly increased sensitivity of adipose and muscle tissue to  insulin action when compared with wild-type controls. Blood pressure was  comparable in SHR versus SHR-Plzf(+/-); however, there was significant  amelioration of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in SHR-Plzf(+/-)  rats. Gene expression profiles in the liver and expression of selected genes in  the heart revealed differentially expressed genes that play a role in metabolic  pathways, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling, and cell  cycle regulation. These results provide evidence for an important role of Plzf in  regulation of metabolic and cardiac traits in the rat and suggest a cross talk  between cell cycle regulators, metabolism, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis."|"plzf,shr,metabolic,fibrosis,genes"|"plzf,shr,fibrosis,gene,metabolic" 
"AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate whether methylation of the  angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promoter increases the risk of essential  hypertension (EH). A total of 96 patients with EH were recruited and 96 sex and  agematched healthy controls. Methylation of 5 CpG dinucleotides in the ACE2  promoter was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Logistic regression and  multiple linear regression were used to adjust for confounding factors and the  generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method was applied to  investigate highorder interactions. Methylation of CpG4 (adjusted P=0.020) and  CpG5 (adjusted P=0.036) was significantly higher in patients with EH, with  frequency 97.56+/-5.65% and 12.75+/-4.15% in EH individuals and 95.73+/-9.11% and  11.47+/-3.67% in healthy controls. GMDR detected significant interaction among  the 5 CpG sites (odds ratio=7.33, adjusted P=0.01). Furthermore, receiver  operating characteristic curves identified that CpG5 methylation was a  significant predictor of EH. Notably, CpG2 methylation was significantly higher  in males than in females (adjusted P=0.018). Conversely, CpG5 methylation was  significantly lower in males (adjusted P=0.032). These results indicated that  aberrant methylation of the ACE2 promoter may be associated with EH risk. In  addition, sex may significantly influence ACE2 methylation."|"methylation,eh,ace2,adjusted,promoter"|"methylation,eh,adjusted,ace2,significantly" 
"AB  - Many patients still have high blood pressure (BP) after treatment with  angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs). We compared the efficacy  and safety of azilsartan to those of olmesartan in a prospective randomized  clinical trial. Sixty-four hypertensive patients who were treated with ARBs other  than azilsartan and olmesartan were enrolled in this study. We randomly assigned   patients to changeover from their prior ARBs to either azilsartan or olmesartan,   and followed the patients for 3 months. Systolic BP (SBP) in the azilsartan group  was significantly decreased at 3 months, and diastolic BP (DBP) and pulse rate  (PR) in the olmesartan group showed significant reductions after 3 months. There   were no significant differences in DeltaSBP, DeltaDBP, or DeltaPR (Delta = the  value at 3 months minus the value at 0 months) between the groups. Serum levels  of creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), and potassium (K) in the azilsartan group  significantly increased after 3 months. While the changes in Cr, UA, and K were  within the respective normal ranges, DeltaSBP was positively associated with  DeltaCr in the azilsartan group. In conclusion, there was no difference in the  depressor effects of azilsartan and olmesartan, and there were no serious changes  in biochemical parameters with azilsartan and olmesartan."|"azilsartan,olmesartan,months,group,patients"|"azilsartan,months,olmesartan,group,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND The CYP17A1 gene encodes for cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP17A1, which is   involved with the steroidogenic pathway including mineralocorticoids. The CYP17A1  polymorphisms might affect enzyme activity, then leading to a state of  mineralocorticoid 11-deoxycorticosterone excess characterized by hypertension,  suppressed plasma renin activity, and low aldosterone concentrations. The aim of   this study was to investigate the contribution of CYP17A1 polymorphisms in  inducing the susceptibility to essential hypertension among the Southwest Han  Chinese population. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms of  CYP17A1 were genotyped in a case-control study for samples by polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS The  polymorphisms rs11191548 and rs4919687 were significantly associated with  hypertension risk, which was confirmed by systolic and diastolic blood pressure  distribution analyses between different genotype groups, and these two  polymorphisms were found in linkage disequilibrium. The rs4919687 polymorphism  was estimated to cause the destruction of exonic splicing silencer (ESR and Motif  3) sites and to transform the transcription factor AREB6 binding site,  respectively, in the bioinformatics analyses. The haplotypes  rs4919686A-rs3740397G -rs4919687C-rs743572C-rs11191548C and  rs4919686A-rs3740397G-rs4919687T-rs743572C- rs11191548T were found to be  susceptible to essential hypertension. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the   CYP17A1 polymorphisms could be a genetic risk factor for essential hypertension  among the Yunnan Han Chinese population, which would have implications for the  treatment of this complex disorder."|"polymorphisms,cyp17a1,hypertension,essential,factor"|"cyp17a1,polymorphisms,hypertension,essential,activity"

The prevalence of  hypertension in the US varies across race/ethnicity with African Americans having  the highest prevalence and overall less control among racial/ethnic minorities  compared with non-Hispanic whites. Therapeutic lifestyle modifications are the  bedrock of essential hypertension control, but most patients with hypertension  will require pharmacotherapy, usually with multiple medications often in  combination. Overall, the principal drug classes recommended as initial  pharmacotherapy are thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers."|"hypertension,pharmacotherapy,overall,control,prevalence"|"hypertension,angiotensin,blockers,control,essential" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension (EH) is defined as a worldwide public health  problem and one of the important risk factors for development of human coronary  artery disease. Increased peripheral arterial resistance is one of the  distinguishing characteristics of EH. The extracellular deposition of calcium in   the arterial wall is defined as vascular calcification, which results in aortic  stiffness and elevation of blood pressure. Regulation of vascular calcification  is physiologically limited by gamma-carboxylated proteins that regulate  mineralization. Any deficiencies related to mineralization influence vascular  calcification. As a result of vitamin-K deficiency or any problem associated with  the vitamin K epOxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) gene, Glu cannot be  transformed to Gla and calcification initiates in blood vessels, myocardium, and   cardiac. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the potential  association of VKORC1 polymorphisms with the risk of EH. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  There were 100 individuals diagnosed with EH and 100 healthy individuals involved  in the study. 3673G/A (rs9923231) and 9041G/A (rs7294) polymorphisms in the  VKORC1 gene were determined by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism  method. RESULTS: A significant difference was found between the rs7294  polymorphisms ratios of the case and control groups, but significant differences   weren't found in distribution of the rs9923231 alleles. Finally it was determined  that the GG genotype provides a 3.97-fold increased risk for EH compared to the  AA genotype for the rs7294 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that  the VKORC1 gene rs7294 polymorphism is important for the development of EH."|"eh,calcification,vkorc1,vascular,risk"|"eh,calcification,rs7294,vkorc1,gene" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension has been identified as one of the commonest modifiable  determinants for chronic kidney disease progression. A variety of  antihypertensive drugs are available and their effect on kidney function has been  investigated by a large number of randomized controlled trials. Observational  studies, although scarcely been used, outpatient can reflect everyday practice,  where drug exposures vary over time, and may provide an alternative for detecting  longitudinal changes in kidney function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied mixed   model repeated measures analysis to investigate the effect of antihypertensive  drug categories and their combinations on kidney function change over time in a  cohort of 779 patients with essential hypertension, using the data from a Greek  hypertension outpatient clinic. Antihypertensive drugs were grouped in 5  categories. Their effect was evaluated and their combinations with and without  renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASI) to each other. In addition, the  combination of RASI with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) was studied. RESULTS:  Diuretics, RASI, CCBs, and beta-blockers had a significant renoprotective and  blood pressure lowering effect. Combinations with RASI had a smaller beneficial  effect on kidney function compared to CCBs (0.75 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year of drug   use versus 0.97 mL/min/1.73 m2). There was no additional effect when combining  RASI with CCBs. However, the lowering effect on systolic blood pressure was  greater (-0.83 mm Hg per year of drug use, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: RASI were  found to have a smaller, although significant, renoprotective effect. There was  no additional effect on kidney function when combining RASI with CCBs."|"effect,kidney,rasi,function,drug"|"effect,rasi,kidney,ccbs,function" 
"AB  - This review aims to introduce the novel concept of embryological target mining  applied to interorgan crosstalk network genesis, and applies embryological target  mining to multidrug-resistant essential hypertension (a prototype, complex,  undertreated, multiorgan systemic syndrome) to uncover new treatment targets and   critique why existing strategies fail. Briefly, interorgan crosstalk pathways  represent the next frontier for target mining in molecular medicine. This is  because stereotyped stepwise organogenesis presents a unique opportunity to infer  interorgan crosstalk pathways that may be crucial to discovering novel treatment   targets.

"AB  - The adrenomedullin receptor is a complex molecule that comprises the  calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and the receptor-activity-modifying  protein (RAMP). RAMP1 is a vasodilation factor, and RAMP1-deficient mice  (RAMP1(-/-)) exhibit inflammatory responses with a significant transient increase  in serum calcitonin-gene-related peptide levels and proinflammatory cytokines  when compared with RAMP1(+/+) mice. The purpose of the present study was to  investigate the relationships between essential hypertension (EH) and RAMP1 gene   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes in a Japanese population via  a case-control study. Based on a database search of the National Center of  Biotechnology Information website and the HapMap project, we chose six RAMP1 gene  SNPs and performed an association study involving 263 patients with EH and 267  age-matched normotensive (NT) subjects. There was no significant difference  between the EH and NT groups with regard to overall distribution of genotypes or   SNP alleles. However, the haplotype-based case-control analysis revealed that  there was a significant difference between the EH and NT groups with regard to  overall distribution of the allele combinations at three  SNPs-rs3754701-rs3769048-rs10199956-(P=0.002). The T-A-T haplotype was  significantly more common in the EH group (10.3%) than in the NT control group  (6.1%) (P=0.047). These results suggested that this T-A-T RAMP1 gene haplotype  might have utility as a genetic marker for EH and that the RAMP1 gene or a  neighbouring gene may be associated with increased susceptibility to EH."|"ramp1,eh,gene,snps,haplotype"|"ramp1,eh,gene,nt,receptor" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic inflammation and impaired function of endothelium play an  important role in the development of hypertension. Our study aimed to analyze an   association between essential hypertension and polymorphic markers in candidate  genes in the group of 530 Tatars from the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia.  METHODS: The study group consisted of 216 male patients with essential  hypertension (mean age 48.92 +/- 8.8 years) and 314 healthy individuals of  corresponding sex and age without history of cardiovascular disease. Association   between studied polymorphisms and essential hypertension was analyzed using  PLINK. RESULTS: We detected an association between EDNRB rs5351, VEGFA  -2549(18)I/D, and ADRB2 rs1042713 polymorphisms and essential hypertension in men  of Tatar ethnic origin. EDNRB, VEGFA, and VCAM1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms  were associated with SBP and DBP. However, only EDNRB rs5351 remained associated   with hypertension after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. A Markov  chain Monte Carlo-based approach implemented in the APSampler program was used to  analyze association of genotype and/or allele combinations with disease. The most  influential in conferring risk of hypertension was EDNRBG/G+ADRB2A+VCAM1A  combination (odds ratio = 4.15, PBonf = 5.43 x 10). CONCLUSION: Our results  suggest that rs5351 single-nucleotide polymorphism is a strong independent  predictor of essential hypertension in men of Tatar ethnic origin."|"hypertension,essential,association,rs5351,polymorphisms"|"hypertension,essential,association,ednrb,polymorphisms" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed higher risk of cardiovascular and  cerebrovascular (CCV) events in primary aldosteronism compared with essential  hypertension, but the patients of these studies were limited to primary  aldosteronism patients with high plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). The  introduction of the aldosterone-renin ratio as the screening test for primary  aldosteronism led to the recognition of primary aldosteronism patients with  normal PAC (nPA). However, there is no information on the risk of primary  aldosteronism including nPA. METHOD: In this retrospectively and cross-sectional   study, the clinical features and CCV event risk of primary aldosteronism at  diagnosis including nPA were investigated and compared with essential  hypertension. The study included 292 consecutive primary aldosteronism patients  and 498 essential hypertension outpatients. All primary aldosteronism patients  were diagnosed by autonomous aldosterone secretion using confirmatory tests, and   then divided into nPA (n = 130) and primary aldosteronism patients with high PAC   (hPA: n = 162) using a PAC cutoff level of less than 443 pmol/l (16 ng/dl),  representing the normal upper limit of PAC. RESULTS: nPA patients were  significantly older at diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and at onset of  hypertension compared with hPA patients. They had milder hypokalemia and  easier-to-control blood pressure. The results suggested that nPA could be  considered a mild type of primary aldosteronism but not an early-stage hPA.  Moreover, the risk of all CCV events in nPA was significantly lower than that in   hPA (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.90, P < 0.05) and not  significantly higher than that in essential hypertension (odds ratio 0.95, 95%  confidence interval 0.43-1.94, P = 0.899). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that  aggressive diagnostic workout for nPA is less effective to prevent CCV events."|"primary,npa,aldosteronism,patients,pac"|"aldosteronism,primary,npa,patients,hypertension" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The overall prevalence of essential hypertension in  adolescents may be growing. Differences in blood pressure (BP) are well  established in adults, but are less clear in adolescents. We hypothesize that the  prevalence of hypertension differs by race/ethnicity among adolescents at  school-based screenings. METHODS: We performed school-based BP screening in over   20 000 adolescents from 2000 to 2015. Race/ethnicity was self-reported. Height  and weight were measured to determine BMI, and BP status was confirmed on 3  occasions to diagnose sustained hypertension according to Fourth Working Group  Report criteria. RESULTS: We successfully screened 21 062 adolescents aged 10 to   19 years (mean, 13.8 years). The final prevalence of sustained hypertension in  all subjects was 2.7%. Obesity rates were highest among African American (3.1%)  and Hispanic (2.7%) adolescents. The highest rate of hypertension was seen in  Hispanic (3.1%), followed by African American (2.7%), white (2.6%), and Asian  (1.7%) adolescents (P = .019). However, obese white adolescents had the highest  prevalence of sustained hypertension (7.4%) compared with obese African American   adolescents (4.5%, P < .001). At lower BMI percentiles (<60th percentile),  Hispanic adolescents actually had the lowest predicted prevalence of hypertension  among the 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hypertension varies among  different race/ethnicities. Although obesity remains the strongest predictor of  early hypertension, the strength of this relationship is intensified in Hispanic   and white adolescents, whereas it is lessened in African American adolescents."|"adolescents,hypertension,prevalence,bp,among"|"adolescents,hypertension,prevalence,african,american" 
"AB  - IMPORTANCE: Increased dietary potassium intake is thought to be associated with  low blood pressure (BP). Whether potassium supplementation may be used as an  antihypertensive agent is a question that should be answered. OBJECTIVE: To  assess the effect of oral potassium supplementation on blood pressure in patients  with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Medline, Web of Science,  Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until October 2016. We  also screened reference lists of articles and previous reviews. We applied no  language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized  placebo-controlled clinical trials addressing the effect of potassium  supplementation on primary hypertension for a minimum of 4 weeks. DATA COLLECTION  AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) at the  final follow-up. We explored the heterogeneity across studies using Cochran's  test and I2 statistic and assessed the probability of publication bias using  Begg's and Egger's tests. We reported the mean difference (MD) of SBP and DBP in   a random-effects model. RESULTS: We found a total of 9059 articles and included  23 trials with 1213 participants. Compared to placebo, potassium supplementation   resulted in modest but significant reductions in both SBP (MD -4.25 mmHg; 95% CI:  -5.96 to -2.53; I2 = 41%) and DBP (MD -2.53 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.05 to -1.02; I2 =  65%). According to the change-score analysis, based on 8 out of 23 trials,  compared to baseline, the mean changes in SBP (MD -8.89 mmHg; 95% CI: -13.67 to  -4.11) and DBP (MD -6.42 mmHg; 95% CI: -10.99 to -1.84) was significantly higher   in the intervention group than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  indicated that potassium supplementation is a safe medication with no important  adverse effects that has a modest but significant impact BP and may be  recommended as an adjuvant antihypertensive agent for patients with essential  hypertension."|"potassium,supplementation,trials,sbp,bp"|"potassium,md,supplementation,95,ci" 
"AB  - We aimed to examine the cross-sectional associations of plasma total homocysteine  (tHcy) concentrations and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR) C677T  genotype with dyslipidemia. A total of 231 patients with mild-to-moderate  essential hypertension were enrolled from the Huoqiu and Yuexi communities in  liquid chromatography. Genotyping was performed by TaqMan allelic discrimination   technique. Compared with MTHFR 677 CC + CT genotype carriers, TT genotype  carriers had higher odds of hypercholesterolemia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] [95%  confidence interval (CI)]: 2.7 [1.4-5.2]; P = .004) and higher odds of abnormal  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 2.3 [1.1-4.8]; P =  .030). The individuals with the TT genotype had higher concentrations of  log(tHcy) than those with the 677 CC + CT genotype (adjusted beta [standard  error]: .2 [0.03]; P < .001). Patients with tHcy >/= 10 mumol/L had significantly  higher odds of hypercholesterolemia (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 2.4 [1.2-4.7]; P =  .010). Furthermore, patients with both the TT genotype and the tHcy >/= 10  mumol/L had the highest odds of hypercholesterolemia (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 4.1  [1.8-9.4]; P = .001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (adjusted OR [95%  CI]: 2.4 [1.0-6.0]; P = .064). This study suggests that both tHcy and the MTHFR  C677T gene polymorphism may be important determinants of the incidence of  dyslipidemia in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. Further studies are  needed to confirm the role of tHcy and the MTHFR C677T mutation in the  development of dyslipidemia in a larger sample."|"thcy,genotype,mthfr,adjusted,odds"|"adjusted,genotype,thcy,95,ci" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Niuhuang Jiangya Preparation (NHJYP) is one of the most commonly used  Our meta-analysis performed a systematic evaluation on the therapeutic efficacy  and safety of NHJYP for EH. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS:  PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, CNKI,VIP, Sinomed, and Wanfang Database  were searched up to June 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing  NHJYP or combined with western antihypertensive drugs (WAD) versus WAD were  included. Quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Reviewers'  Handbook 5. 1.0. Statistical software (RevMan 5.3) was used for data analysis.  The primary outcome was categorical or continuous blood pressure, and the  secondary outcome was Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome. RESULTS: 12  RCTs including 1651 cases were identified. The methodological quality of trials  was low. Meta-analysis showed that, firstly, NHJYP used alone compared with WAD  had no significant effect on BP reduction; however, subgroup analysis was used  based on whether apply TCM diagnostic criteria in recruitment. It was suggested  that, for population that applied TCM diagnostic criteria, RR=1.35,95%  CI:1.17-1.56P<0.0001; for population that didn't apply TCM diagnostic criteria,  RR=0.96,95% CI0.70-1.33P=0.81.Reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels  showed similar results. But there was no significant difference in improving  diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Secondly, we found that NHJYP plus WAD probably  lower BP (RR=1.1395% CI:1.03-1.24,P=0.01)and improve TCM symptoms than WAD only.   And subgroup analysis suggested significant BP reduction effect for population  that applied TCM diagnostic. No serious adverse events were reported.  CONCLUSIONS: Our review indicated that NHJYP has some beneficial effects in EH  patients with liver-yang hyperactivity and abundant phlegm-heat syndrome.  However, the evidence is not reliable enough. To produce definite evidence, more   rigorously designed trials are needed."|"nhjyp,analysis,wad,used,tcm"|"analysis,nhjyp,tcm,wad,diagnostic" 
"AB  - Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most common emerging disease in developing  countries. It alters endothelial cell structure and function, resulting in  several diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral vasculopathy,  cerebrovascular disease and nephropathy. Although much progress has been made in   researching HTN in recent years, early diagnosis and treatment of HTN are not yet  satisfactory, and progression control/treatment is still poor. MicroRNAs are  well-known regulators of the physiological and developmental processes of HTN.  Our results revealed that miR-510 was upregulated in blood samples from HTN  patients, whereas no significant differences were observed in the control  samples. Methylation analyses corroborated the miR-510 upregulation in patient  samples. These results suggested that miR-510 can be used as a novel biomarker  for diagnosis and as a new therapeutic target for HTN."|"htn,disease,samples,mir,control"|"htn,510,disease,mir,samples" 
"AB  - Context: Catecholamines may contribute to the accumulation of collagen fibers and  extracellular matrix in the arterial and myocardial wall due to various  mechanisms. Reversibility of this process has not been studied on both structures  simultaneously. Objective: To clarify the long-term effect of excess  normalization of catecholamines on carotid and myocardial wall changes in  patients with pheochromocytoma or functional paraganglioma (PHEO) after tumor  removal. Design, Settings, and Patients: Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and  the left ventricular (LV) mass index were studied in 50 patients with PHEO before  tumor removal and 5 years after tumor removal, and in 50 blood pressure- and  age-matched essential hypertensive patients before follow-up and after 5 years of  follow-up. Main Outcome Measures: Common carotid artery (CCA)-IMT and LV mass  indexed to lean body mass (LBM). Results: Elimination of catecholamine excess in   the PHEO group resulted in a significant decrease in CCA-IMT and LV mass index  from 0.86 +/- 0.17 to 0.83 +/- 0.18 mm (P < 0.05) and from 3.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.9 +/-  0.9 g/LBM (P < 0.001), respectively. In contrast, CCA-IMT and LV mass index  increased significantly from 0.78 +/- 0.14 to 0.81 +/- 0.15 mm (P < 0.05) and  from 3.1 +/- 0.7 to 3.2 +/- 0.6 g/LBM (P < 0.05), respectively, in patients with   essential hypertension. Conclusion: In patients with PHEO, carotid IMT and LV  mass index can significantly regress after tumor removal, in contrast to the  impairment of these parameters in essential hypertensive patients during the same  long-term period."|"patients,carotid,mass,imt,pheo"|"patients,mass,imt,lv,carotid" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is affected by both genetic and environmental  factors. The polymorphism of connexin (Cx) genes is found associated with the  development of hypertension. However, the association of the polymorphism of Cxs   with EH has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the  association of the polymorphism of connexin (Cx) genes Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 with   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and  matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF-MS) were used to analyze the polymorphism of Cx genes in Kazak and Han  EH patients as well as their normotensive controls. The results showed that there  were no significant differences in the frequencies of different three genotypes  (A/A, A/G, and G/G) and A and G alleles of Cx40 rs35594137 and rs11552588 between  EH patients and normotensive controls. However, in Kazak EH patients, the  frequencies of three genotypes (A/A, A/G, and G/G) of Cx37 rs1630310 were 24.8%,   47.2% and 28.0%, respectively, which were significantly different from those in  Han EH patients. In Han EH patients, the frequencies of the three genotypes (C/C,  C/G and G/G) of Cx43 rs1925223 were 6.4%, 35.6% and 58.0%, respectively.  Frequencies of the other four genotypes had no statistical differences among  Kazak and Han EH patients and their normotensive controls. These results suggest   polymorphisms of Cx37 rs1630310 and Cx43 rs1925223 genes may be associated with  the pathogenesis of EH. Carrying Cx37 rs1630310-A or Cx43 rs1925223-G genotypes  may protect against the development of EH."|"eh,polymorphism,genes,genotypes,patients"|"eh,patients,genotypes,polymorphism,cx37" 
"AB  - Commonly used tests for diagnosis of salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) are  complex and time-consuming, so new methods are required. Many studies have  demonstrated roles for miRNAs in hypertension; however, the diagnostic value of  miRNAs has yet to be determined for human SSH. In this study, we examined miRNA  expression profiles by initial high-throughput miRNA sequencing of samples from  patients with salt-sensitive and salt-resistant hypertension (SSH and SRH,  respectively; n = 6, both groups), followed by validation by quantitative  real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a larger cohort (n = 91). We  also evaluated differences in baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, body mass  index, consumption of specific foods) between the SSH and SRH groups. Of 36  miRNAs identified as differentially expressed between SSH and SRH groups by  RNA-Seq, 8 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. There were significant differences in the  expression levels of hsa-miR-361-5p and hsa-miR-362-5p between the 2 groups (P =   .023 and.049, respectively). In addition, there were significant differences in  sauce and poultry consumption between the 2 groups (P = .004 and.001,  respectively). The areas under the curve (AUC) determined by receptor operating  characteristic (ROC) analysis for hsa-miR-361-5p and all 8 miRNAs were 0.793 (95%  CI, 0.698-0.888; sensitivity = 73.9%, specificity = 74.4%; P < .001) and 0.836  (95% CI, 0.749-0.922; sensitivity = 80.4%, specificity = 81.4%; P < .001),  respectively, when sauce and poultry consumption were included in the models.  Assay feasibility and economic considerations make hsa-miR-361-5p combined with  the dietary factors the preferred markers for diagnosis of SSH."|"ssh,groups,mirnas,differences,consumption"|"ssh,groups,5p,hsa,mir" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: During the transition from premenopause to postmenopause, many women  experience weight gain and central fat deposition; therefore, we hypothesized  that circulating growth factors can play a role in the pathogenesis of  hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and subclinical organ damage in perimenopausal   women. BASIC PROCEDURES: The study included 192 women aged 40 to 60years; 152 had  newly diagnosed essential hypertension that had never been treated, and 40 were  normotensive age-matched controls. For all subjects, 24-h ambulatory blood  pressure monitoring (ABPM), echocardiographic examination with assessment of left  ventricular mass (LVM) and systolic and diastolic functions (GE Vivid 7.0,  General Electric Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway), carotid ultrasound with  measurement of intima-media thickness, and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity  (PWV) measurement (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) were performed.   Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth  factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), and insulin-like growth factor-binding  protein 3 (IGFBP-3) were measured using an immunochemical assay. MAIN FINDINGS:  Hypertensive women had significantly lower IGFBP-2 levels than did normotensive  controls (162.9+/-83.7 vs. 273.1+/-103.0mug/L, p<0.001); the groups did not  differ regarding IGF and IGFBP-3 concentrations. After adjusting the covariates,   multivariate analysis showed that IGFBP2 was significantly negatively correlated   with 24-h systolic blood pressure (beta=-0.31, p=0.02). The adjusted odds ratio  for hypertension per standard deviation decrease in IGFBP-2 was 3.43 (95%  confidence interval [CI] 1.65-7.13). IGFBP-2 showed a negative correlation with  the number of metabolic syndrome components. Independent of body composition,  IGFBP-2 was significantly related to left ventricular relative wall thickness and  the ratio of mitral inflow velocities as parameter of diastolic function.  PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: In perimenopausal women, decreased IGFBP-2 levels may play  a role in blood pressure regulation and the development of subclinical left  ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Whether IGFBP-2 is a marker or a mediator of  cardiovascular disease in this population merits further investigation."|"igfbp,women,hypertension,significantly,left"|"igfbp,women,growth,blood,diastolic" 
"AB  - Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in detecting  genetic loci involved in complex traits, few susceptibility genes have been  detected for essential hypertension (EH). We aimed to use pooled DNA GWAS  approach to identify and validate novel genomic loci underlying EH susceptibility  in an Australian case-control population. Blood samples and questionnaires  detailing medical history, blood pressure, and prescribed medications were  collected for 409 hypertensives and 409 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched  normotensive controls. Case and control DNA were pooled in quadruplicate and  hybridized to Illumina 1 M-Duo arrays. Allele frequencies agreed with those  reported in reference data and known EH association signals were represented in  the top-ranked SNPs more frequently than expected by chance. Validation showed  that pooled DNA GWAS gave reliable estimates of case and control allele  frequencies. Although no markers reached Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide  significance levels (5.0 x 10(-8)), the top marker rs34870220 near ASGR1  approached significance (p = 4.32 x 10(-7)), as did several candidate loci (p < 1  x 10(-6)) on chromosomes 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 17. Four markers (located in or near  genes NHSL1, NKFB1, GLI2, and LRRC10) from the top ten ranked SNPs were  individually genotyped in pool samples and were tested for association between  cases and controls using the chi (2) test. Of these, rs1599961 (NFKB1) and  rs12711538 (GLI2) showed significant difference between cases and controls (p <  0.01). Additionally, four top-ranking markers within NFKB1 were found to be in  LD, suggesting a single strong association signal for this gene."|"association,top,eh,gwas,controls"|"association,10,case,control,controls" 
"AB  - Mutations in mitochondrial (mt)transfer (t)RNA (mttRNA) have been reported to  serve important roles in hypertension. To determine the underlying molecular  mechanisms of mttRNA mutations in hypertension, the present study screened for  mttRNA mutations in a Chinese family with a high incidence of essential  hypertension. Sequence analysis of the mttRNA genes in this family revealed the  presence of an A4401G mutation in the glycineand methioninetRNA genes, and a  G5821A mutation in the cysteinetRNA (tRNACys) gene. The G5821A mutation was  located at a position conserved in various species, and disrupted G6C67  basepairing. It was hypothesized that the G5821A mutation may decrease the  baseline expression levels of tRNACys, and consequently result in failure of tRNA  metabolism. The A4401G mutation was reported to cause the mitochondrial  dysfunction responsible for hypertension. Thus, the combination of G5821A and  A4401G mutations may contribute to the high incidence of hypertension in this  family. MttRNA mutations may serve as potential biomarkers for hypertension."|"hypertension,mttrna,mutation,mutations,g5821a"|"hypertension,mttrna,mutation,mutations,g5821a" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to determine whether changes in  hemorheological parameters parallel the severity of essential hypertension.  METHODS: A total of 198 older hypertensive patients were recruited and classified  into 3 stages of hypertension according to the grading standard of hypertension.   The whole blood viscosity (WBV) at various shear rates, plasma viscosity and  erythrocyte rheology (including erythrocyte rigidity index, erythrocyte  aggregation index and erythrocyte deformation index) were examined. RESULTS:  Erythrocyte rheology paralleled the severity of essential hypertension and was  significantly correlated to the average 24 h systolic blood pressure and  diastolic blood pressure. Logistic analysis revealed that erythrocyte rigidity  and the erythrocyte aggregation index were positively correlated with the  severity of hypertension, while the erythrocyte deformation index was negatively   correlated. No association was found between WBV, plasma viscosity and the  severity of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The rheological properties of erythrocyte  viscosity were correlated with the severity of hypertension in older people but  the WBV and plasma viscosity were not."|"hypertension,severity,erythrocyte,correlated,viscosity"|"erythrocyte,hypertension,index,severity,viscosity" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive  patients appears to be a desirable goal to the reduction cardiac risk. The  Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) seems to play a major role in the establishment  and maintenance of LVH through the activated systemic RAS and the Intracardiac  Angiotensin System (IAS). We focused on the effects of a three-year treatment  with losartan supplement in hypertensive patients with LVH not responding to  eight years of an effective previous antihypertensive pharmacological treatment.   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of 28 sex-, age- and therapy-matched subjects  with essential hypertension and LVH were taken into consideration. The two groups  were in effective pharmacological treatment (BP < 140/90) for eight years  previous to their enrollment. Patients of Group A were treated for three years  with a losartan (100 mg/die) on-top treatment, whereas patients of Group B  continued the follow-up of the previous conventional therapy. Both groups were  submitted to an echocardiographic follow-up. RESULTS: Group A, showed a  significant reduction of the mean LVH since the first step at six months with a  further significant trend during the whole period (variance analysis: p < 0.001).  Group B showed a non-significant trend toward LVH reduction during the three-year  follow-up. No significant further reduction of systolic or diastolic blood  pressure values was observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of losartan  in hypertensive and hypertrophic patients are in agreement with the results of  LIFE Trial. However, the reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy in our  patients seems to be related to changes inducted by losartan on the IAS, since no  further hemodynamic effects were observed. Losartan induced both a significant  reduction of LVH and an improvement of LV diastolic function with a subsequent  expected beneficial shift on the prognosis."|"lvh,patients,reduction,losartan,significant"|"lvh,patients,reduction,losartan,significant" 
"AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of  treadmill training at lactate threshold intensity on maximum time to exhaustion  (MTE) and heart rate (HR) as well as behavioral changes after kainate  (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male SHRs were divided in four groups: two sedentary  (vehicle- and KA-treated) and two exercised (vehicle- and KA-treated),  respectively. The exercised rats were trained on a treadmill at a speed of 20  m.min-1 and 0 degrees elevation for 40 min.d-1, for 4 wk. Maximal time to  exhaustion and HR was measured at the beginning and at the end of the training  period. Status epilepticus was evoked in half of the sedentary and trained rats  by a repetitive intraperitoneal injection of KA in low subconvulsive doses. The  other half of the groups received saline. Sucrose preference test (SPT) for  depression-like behavior and hole board test (HBT) for impulsivity were performed  a month after KA/veh injection. RESULTS: The maximum time of exhaustion was  elongated in the SHRs at the end of the training period in comparison with the  beginning. However, no effect on HR was detected in trained rats. Kainate  treatment after one month of training alleviated the SE-induced anhedonia in SPT   and stereotyped behavior in HBT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these  results demonstrate that exercise exerts a beneficial influence on physical  working capacity, depression and impulsive behavior in a co-morbid model of  essential hypertension and SE."|"ka,rats,training,behavior,shrs"|"ka,rats,training,behavior,exhaustion" 
"AB  - Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common secondary cause of hypertension.  The present study investigated differences in left ventricular structure and  function between hypertensive patients with PA and sucjects with essential  hypertension (EH). One hundred patients with PA and 100 controls with EH were  matched for age, gender, and 24-h ambulatory monitoring blood pressure (BP). Left  ventricular mass index (LVMI), left atrial volume index (LAVI) and ejection  fraction were calculated. LV diastolic function was estimated as the ratio of the  early diastolic velocities (E) from transmitral inflow to the early diastolic  velocities (e') of tissue Doppler at mitral annulus. PA and EH patients had  similar LV dimensions, LV wall thicknesses, LVMI and LV systolic function. PA was  associated with greater impairment in diastolic function, as reflected by the  lower e' (P=0.004), higher E/e' ratio (P=0.005) and higher LAVI (P=0.02). The LV   geometric dimensions and patterns of LV hypertrophy were similar between male  patients from the PA and EH groups. However, in female patients, PA was  correlated with higher LV internal dimensions (P=0.001), higher LVMI (P=0.04) and  lower relative wall thickness (RWT, P=0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that  LV diastolic function was independently correlated with age (beta=0.416,  P<0.001), 24-h systolic BP (beta=0.238, P=0.016) and serum potassium  (beta=-0.201, P=0.036) in PA patients. In conclusion, PA appears to contribute to  the impairment of LV diastolic function in both sexes as well as the higher  prevalence of eccentric hypertrophy in women than in men compared with EH. Age,  24-h systolic BP and serum potassium levels are independent risk factors for LV  diastolic function in PA patients."|"pa,lv,function,diastolic,patients"|"lv,pa,diastolic,function,patients" 
"AB  - Although plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) varies depending on primary  aldosteronism (PA) subtypes, patients with different subtypes may have similar  blood pressure (BP). The authors hypothesized that hormones other than  aldosterone might influence BP in PA patients. A total of 73 PA cases, including   30 cases of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs), 29 cases of bilateral  hyperaldosteronism, and 24 control cases of essential hypertension were enrolled   retrospectively. The authors examined the levels of aldosterone, cortisol, renin,  and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) measured at 12 am, 6 am, 12 pm, and 6 pm  and BP in the early morning (6 am to 7 am), late morning (9 am to 11 am), and  early evening (5 pm to 7 pm). Results showed no statistically significant  correlation between PAC and BP in the patients with PA; however, early and late  morning systolic BP strongly correlated with ACTH at 6 am in patients with APA.  These results suggest that hormones other than aldosterone, such as ACTH, may  affect BP in patients with APA."|"aldosterone,bp,patients,acth,cases"|"bp,aldosterone,patients,cases,pa" 
"AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in myocardial and vascular remodeling and   have emerged as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or as therapeutic   targets. The authors aimed to investigate the expression profile of selected  miRNAs in the peripheral blood of patients with well-controlled essential  hypertension in relation to arterial stiffness. Expression levels of miRNAs  miRNA-1, miRNA-133a, miRNA-26b, miRNA-208b, miRNA-499, and miRNA-21 in peripheral  blood mononuclear cells were quantified by real-time reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and  carotid radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) were evaluated at baseline and after 1  year of effective antihypertensive therapy. A total of 95 patients (50 men, mean   age 62+/-9 years) with well-controlled essential hypertension were included in  the analysis. Only miRNA-21 was independently correlated with changes in both  cfPWV and crPWV, independently of blood pressure levels (r=-0.56 and r=-0.46,  respectively; P<.001 for both). Low levels of miRNA-21 are strongly associated  with an improvement in arterial stiffness in patients with well-controlled  essential hypertension, independently of their blood pressure levels. These data   highlight the significance of miRNA-21 in vascular remodeling and its role as a  potential prognostic marker and future therapeutic target."|"mirna,blood,levels,patients,mirnas"|"mirna,21,blood,levels,controlled" 
"AB  - Practical relevance: Feline hypertension is a common disease in older cats that  is frequently diagnosed in association with other diseases such as chronic kidney  disease and hyperthyroidism (so-called secondary hypertension), although some  cases of apparent primary hypertension are also reported. The clinical  consequences of hypertension can be severe, related to 'target organ damage'  (eye, heart and vasculature, brain and kidneys), and early diagnosis followed by   appropriate therapeutic management should help reduce the morbidity associated  with this condition. Clinical challenges: Despite being a common disease, routine  blood pressure (BP) monitoring is generally performed infrequently, probably  leading to underdiagnosis of feline hypertension in clinical practice. There is a  need to: (i) ensure BP is measured as accurately as possible with a reproducible   technique; (ii) identify and monitor patients at risk of developing hypertension;  (iii) establish appropriate criteria for therapeutic intervention; and (iv)  establish appropriate therapeutic targets. Based on current data, amlodipine  besylate is the treatment of choice to manage feline hypertension and is  effective in the majority of cats, but the dose needed to successfully manage  hypertension varies between individuals. Some cats require long-term adjuvant  therapy and, occasionally, additional therapy is necessary for emergency  management of hypertensive crises. Evidence base: These Guidelines from the  International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) are based on a comprehensive  review of the currently available literature, and are aimed at providing  practical recommendations to address the challenges of feline hypertension for  veterinarians. There are many areas where more data is required which, in the  future, will serve to confirm or modify some of the recommendations in these  Guidelines."|"hypertension,feline,disease,cats,clinical"|"hypertension,feline,appropriate,cats,clinical" 
"AB  - MicroRNAs (miRs) are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in all  eukaryotic cells and have a vital role in the evolution of hypertension and  cardiovascular remodelling and, therefore, have emerged as potential biomarkers  for cardiovascular disease. We assessed 240 participants, including 60 healthy  volunteers with normal carotid intima-media thickness (nCIMT), 60 healthy  volunteers with increased CIMT (iCIMT), 60 hypertensive patients with nCIMT and  60 hypertensive patients with iCIMT. All patients underwent measurements of CIMT,  carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and ambulatory blood pressure (BP)  monitoring. Plasma miR-92a expression was quantified by real-time reverse  transcription PCR. Correlations between miR-92a expression and BP parameters,  CIMT and cfPWV were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. We  observed the lowest miR-92a expression (24.59+/-1.30 vs 27.76+/-2.13 vs  29.29+/-1.89 vs 33.76+/-2.08; P<0.001) in healthy controls with nCIMT, followed  by healthy controls with iCIMT, then hypertensive patients with nCIMT and the  highest expression in hypertensive patients with iCIMT. Additionally, MiR-92a  levels showed a significant positive correlation with 24-h mean systolic BP  (r=0.807, P<0.001), 24-h mean diastolic BP (r=0.649, P<0.001), 24-h mean pulse  pressure (PP) (r=0.697, P<0.001), 24-h daytime PP (r=0.654, P<0.001), 24-h  nighttime PP (r=0.573, P<0.001), CIMT (r=0.571, P<0.001) and cfPWV (r=0.601,  P<0.001). Our data present significant evidence that circulating miR-92a  represents a potential noninvasive atherosclerosis marker in essential  hypertensive patients."|"expression,mir,cimt,cfpwv,bp"|"001,24,patients,92a,expression" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Stimulation of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor in the rostral  ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) increases renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA)  and blood pressure (BP) in rats. Thus, we hypothesized that abnormal expression  of CB1 receptor in the RVLM may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of  essential hypertension. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of intra-RVLM infusions  of arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA), selective CB1 receptor agonist, with  or without AM251, selective CB1 receptor antagonist, on BP, heart rate (HR), and   RSNA in spontaneously hypertensive rats and wild-type rats. We also assessed the   protein level and surface expression of CB1 receptor in the RVLM in these rats.  RESULTS: We found that spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibited higher basal BP,  HR, and RSNA than wild-type rats. Furthermore, unilateral intra-RVLM  microinjections ACEA (0, 10, or 100 nM/0.5 mul/site) increased BP, HR, and RSNA  to a greater extent in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in wild-type rats.  These effects were abolished by co-administrations of AM251 (500 nM/0.5 mul/site)  into the RVLM. In addition, the protein level of CB1 receptor in the RVLM was  robustly increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats, which is correlated with  ACEA-induced maximum changes of RSNA, and this was also associated with reduced  expression of beta-arrestin 2 in the RVLM in spontaneously hypertensive rats.  Finally, overexpression of beta-arrestin 2 in the RVLM in spontaneously  hypertensive rats attenuated BP, HR and RSNA. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our  results suggested that alterations of CB1 receptor desensitization in the RVLM  may play a role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension."|"rvlm,rats,cb1,receptor,rsna"|"rats,rvlm,cb1,receptor,hypertensive" 
"AB  - KEY POINTS: Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC)3 and TRPC6 channels of   vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) mediate stretch- or agonist-induced cationic  fluxes, contributing to membrane potential and vascular tone. Native TRPC3/C6  channels can form homo- or heterotetrameric complexes, which can hinder  individual TRPC channel properties. The possibility that the differences in their  association pattern may change their contribution to vascular tone in  hypertension is unexplored. Functional characterization of heterologously  expressed channels showed that TRPC6-containing complexes exhibited  Pyr3/Pyr10-sensitive currents, whereas TRPC3-mediated currents were blocked by  anti-TRPC3 antibodies. VSMCs from hypertensive (blood pressure high; BPH) mice  have larger cationic basal currents insensitive to Pyr10 and sensitive to  anti-TRPC3 antibodies. Consistently, myography studies showed a larger  Pyr3/10-induced vasodilatation in BPN (blood pressure normal) mesenteric  arteries. We conclude that the increased TRPC3 channel expression in BPH VSMCs  leads to changes in TRPC3/C6 heteromultimeric assembly, with a higher TRPC3  channel contribution favouring depolarization of hypertensive VSMCs. ABSTRACT:  Increased vascular tone in essential hypertension involves a sustained rise in  total peripheral resistance. A model has been proposed in which the combination  of membrane depolarization and higher L-type Ca(2+) channel activity generates  augmented Ca(2+) influx into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), contraction  and vasoconstriction. The search for culprit ion channels responsible for  membrane depolarization has provided several candidates, including members of the  canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family. TRPC3 and TRPC6 are  diacylglycerol-activated, non-selective cationic channels contributing to  stretch- or agonist-induced depolarization. Conflicting information exists  regarding changes in TRPC3/TRPC6 functional expression in hypertension. However,   although TRPC3-TRPC6 channels can heteromultimerize, the possibility that  differences in their association pattern may change their functional contribution  to vascular tone is largely unexplored. We probe this hypothesis using a model of  essential hypertension (BPH mice; blood pressure high) and its normotensive  control (BPN mice; blood pressure normal). First, non-selective cationic currents  through homo- and heterotetramers recorded from transfected Chinese hamster ovary  cells indicated that TRPC currents were sensitive to the selective antagonist  Pyr10 only when TRPC6 was present, whereas intracellular anti-TRPC3 antibody  selectively blocked TRPC3-mediated currents. In mesenteric VSMCs, basal and  agonist-induced currents were more sensitive to Pyr3 and Pyr10 in BPN cells.  Consistently, myography studies showed a larger Pyr3/10-induced vasodilatation in  BPN mesenteric arteries. mRNA and protein expression data supported changes in  TRPC3 and TRPC6 proportions and assembly, with a higher TRPC3 channel  contribution in BPH VSMCs that could favour cell depolarization. These  differences in functional and pharmacological properties of TRPC3 and TRPC6  channels, depending on their assembly, could represent novel therapeutical  opportunities."|"trpc3,channels,trpc6,vsmcs,depolarization"|"trpc3,trpc6,channels,currents,vsmcs" 
"AB  - The present study aimed to identify the microRNA (miRNA) responsible for the  development of primary hypertension, and examine the downstream signaling  pathway, which mediates the effect of the miRNA. Reverse  transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to  identify which miRNA may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In  silico analysis and a luciferase assay were used to validate the target of the  selected miRNA, and miRNA mimics and small interfering (si)RNA of the target were  transfected into smooth muscle cells to examine its effect on the biological  activity of the cells. miR34b was found to be upregulated in spontaneously  hypertensive rats (SHRs), compared with Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Therefore, the  present study used online miRNA target prediction tools to predict the candidate   target genes of miR34b in the database, and consequently identified cyclin G1  (CCNG1) and cyclindependent kinase 6 (CDK6) as its possible target genes. CDK6  subsequently identified to be the direct target gene of miR34b using a luciferase  reporter assay in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The present study also  established the possible negative regulatory association between miR34b and CDK6   via investigating the mRNA and protein expression levels of CDK6 and CCNG1 in  VSMCs collected from the SHRs and WKY rats, respectively. To investigate the  signaling pathways between miR34b and CDK6, the mRNA and protein expression  levels of CDK6, and the proliferation rates were compared in VSMCs transfected  with CDK6 siRNA or miR34b mimics, the results of which indicated that the miR34b   mimics exerted the same effects on the expression of CDK6 and cell proliferation   as CDK6 siRNA. The negative regulatory association between miR34b and its target,  CDK6, was confirmed, which may offer potential as a novel therapeutic target in  the treatment of hypertension."|"target,mir34b,cdk6,mirna,vsmcs"|"cdk6,mir34b,target,mirna,cells" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Eplerenone is an aldosterone receptor blocker that is chemically  derived from spironolactone. In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive  therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart  Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular  systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with  heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for   the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot  be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the  clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone  antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No  previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on  cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in   patients with hypertension. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of eplerenone  monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of  interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal  myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non fatal strokes),  adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic  blood pressure. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised  Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016.   We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed   in the initial search. We also searched for unpublished data by contacting the  corresponding authors of the included studies and pharmaceutical companies  involved in conducting studies on eplerenone monotherapy in primary hypertension.  The search had no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected  randomized placebo-controlled trials studying adult patients with primary  hypertension. We excluded studies in people with secondary or gestational  hypertension and studies where participants were receiving multiple  antihypertensives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors  independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three  review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a  standardized data extraction form. A fourth independent review author resolved  discrepancies or disagreements. We performed data extraction and synthesis using   a standardized format on Covidence. We conducted data analysis using Review  Manager 5. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1437 adult patients participated in the five   randomized parallel group studies, with treatment durations ranging from 8 to 16   weeks. The daily doses of eplerenone ranged from 25 mg to 400 mg daily.  Meta-analysis of these studies showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of  9.21 mmHg (95% CI -11.08 to -7.34; I(2) = 58%) and a reduction of diastolic  pressure of 4.18 mmHg (95% CI -5.03 to -3.33; I(2) = 0%) (moderate quality  evidence).There may be a dose response effect for eplerenone in the reduction in   systolic blood pressure at doses of 400 mg/day. However, this finding is  uncertain, as it is based on a single included study with low quality evidence.  Overall there does not appear to be a clinically important dose response in  lowering systolic or diastolic blood pressure at eplerenone doses of 50 mg to 400  mg daily. There did not appear to be any differences in the number of patients  who withdrew due to adverse events or the number of patients with at least one  adverse event in the eplerenone group compared to placebo. However, only three of  the five included studies reported adverse events. Most of the included studies  were of moderate quality, as we judged multiple domains as being at unclear risk   in the 'Risk of bias' assessment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Eplerenone 50 to 200  mg/day lowers blood pressure in people with primary hypertension by 9.21 mmHg  systolic and 4.18 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, with no difference of  effect between doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. A dose of 25 mg/day did not  produce a statistically significant reduction in systolic or diastolic blood  pressure and there is insufficient evidence for doses above 200 mg/day. There is   currently no available evidence to determine the effect of eplerenone on  clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality or morbidity in hypertensive  patients. The evidence available on side effects is insufficient and of low  quality, which makes it impossible to draw conclusions about potential harm  associated with eplerenone treatment in hypertensive patients."|"eplerenone,patients,studies,hypertension,systolic"|"eplerenone,studies,mg,patients,hypertension" 
"AB  - Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism. Metabolic disorders of uric  acid are associated with many disease states. Substantial evidence suggests the  possible role of uric acid as a mediator of high blood pressure. Elevated uric  acid is closely associated with new onset essential hypertension in adolescents  and prehypertension; and urate-lowering agents can significantly improve these  early stages of hypertension. Uric acid also influences salt sensitivity of blood  pressure through two phases. Local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  activation initiates renal damage, arteriolopathy, and endothelium dysfunction,  which is followed by the dysregulation of sodium homeostasis, thereby leading to   increased salt sensitivity. In this review we summarize the available evidence to  contribute to a better understanding of the casual relationship between uric acid  and early or intermediate stages of hypertension. We hope our review can  contribute to the prevention of hypertension or provide new insights into a  treatment that would slow the progression of hypertension."|"acid,uric,hypertension,new,sensitivity"|"acid,uric,hypertension,associated,blood" 
"AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of canrenone as add-on therapy in patients already  treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II  receptor blockers (ARBs) and hydrochlorothiazide at the maximum dosage (25 mg/d).  METHOD: In this randomized, open-label, controlled trial, we enrolled 175  Caucasian patients with essential hypertension not well controlled by concomitant  ACE-I or ARBs and hydrochlorothiazide. At baseline, 87 patients (57 males and 30   females) were randomized to add canrenone 50 mg, and 88 (56 males and 32 females)  patients to canrenone 100 mg, once a day, for 3 months. At baseline and after 3  months, we evaluated blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate (HR),  fasting plasma glucose (FPG), homeostasis model assessment insulin (HOMA Index),   lipid profile, electrolytes, uric acid, estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR), plasma urea, aldosterone, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and  galectin-3. RESULTS: Blood pressure decreased with both dosages of canrenone,  with a better effect with canrenone 100 mg (-20.26 vs -23.68 mm Hg for SBP, and  -10.58 vs -12.38 mm Hg for DBP), without a clinically relevant increase in  potassium levels. We did not observe any differences regarding FPG or HOMA Index,  nor of lipid profile, with the exception of triglycerides, which increased  compared to baseline with canrenone 50 mg (+0.25 vs +0.34 mEq/L). Creatinine  slightly increased with canrenone 100 mg (+0.02 vs +0.05 mg/dL), although no  variations of eGFR were observed in neither groups. There was an increase in  aldosterone levels with canrenone 50 mg. No changes in BNP or galectin-3 were  recorded. CONCLUSION: Both canrenone dosages gave a decrease in blood pressure,  with a better effect with the higher dose, with only a slight increase in  potassium and creatinine levels, which were not clinically relevant.

"AB  - Hypertension is defined as a persistently elevated blood pressure >/=140/90mmHg.   It is an important treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with a high   prevalence in the general population. The most common cause, essential  hypertension, is a widespread disease - however, secondary hypertension is under   investigated and under diagnosed. Collectively, hypertension is referred to as a   "silent killer" - frequently it displays no overt symptomatology. It is a leading  risk factor for death and disability globally, with >40% of persons aged over 25   having hypertension. A vast spectrum of conditions result in hypertension  spanning essential through resistant, to patients with an overt endocrine cause.   A significant number of patients with hypertension have multiple cardiovascular  risk factors at the time of presentation. Both routine and specialised  biochemical investigations are paramount for the evaluation of these patients and  their subsequent management. Biochemical testing serves to identify those  hypertensive individuals who are at higher risk on the basis of evidence of  dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, renal impairment, or target organ damage and to  exclude identifiable causes of hypertension. The main target of biochemical  testing is the identification of patients with a specific and treatable aetiology  of hypertension. Information gleaned from biochemical investigation is used to  risk stratify patients and tailor the type and intensity of subsequent management  and treatment. We review the approach to the biochemical investigation of  patients presenting with hypertension and propose a diagnostic algorithm for  work-up."|"hypertension,risk,patients,biochemical,disease"|"hypertension,patients,biochemical,risk,cardiovascular" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although corticotropin is a representative secretagogue of  aldosterone, the utility of the cosyntropin stimulation test (C-ST) in diagnosing  primary aldosteronism (PA) has not been elucidated. Aim of the study was to  evaluate the clinical utility of C-ST for confirmatory testing and subtype  classification of PA. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: In this retrospective study,   we identified patients with hypertension and positive case-detection results for   PA who underwent C-ST and saline infusion testing (SIT) between 2006 and 2013 at   eight referral centres in Japan. PA and essential hypertension (EH) were  distinguished based on SIT results. PA subtype classification was determined by  adrenal venous sampling (AVS). Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was  measured before and 30 and 60 min after intravenous cosyntropin administration.  The ability of C-ST to distinguish PA from EH and to distinguish unilateral from   bilateral disease was assessed by the area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve. RESULTS: Of 205 patients with hypertension and positive  case-detection results, 139 (68%) had PA based on SIT results. Eighteen patients   in whom AVS was unsuccessful were excluded from analysis. The baseline PAC before  C-ST was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in patients with PA than in those with  EH. However, the degree of difference in PAC between patients with PA and EH was   not enhanced by the administration of cosyntropin. In addition, the  administration of cosyntropin did not improve the distinction between bilateral  and unilateral PA subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: C-ST has no utility as a confirmatory  and subtype testing of PA when the diagnosis of PA is based on the positive  results in SIT."|"pa,st,patients,cosyntropin,eh"|"pa,patients,results,st,cosyntropin" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical significance of  baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in risk  stratification of hypertensives and subjects with high normal blood pressure  (SHNBP). METHODS A total of 20 patients (61+/-13 years of age, 10 female/10 male)  with essential, treated hypertension and 20 subjects (59+/-8 years of age, 10  female/10 male) with high normal blood pressure were enrolled. The  interrelationship between BRS expressed in ms/mmHg (BRS) and IMT of common  carotid artery (CCA) in hypertensives and subjects with high normal blood  pressure (SHNBP, prehypertensives) was evaluated. BRS was determined by the  sequence and spectral method: a five-minute non-invasive beat-to-beat recording  of blood pressure (BP) and R-R interval with use of Collin CBM-7000 monitor,  controlled breathing at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Duplex ultrasonographic  examination of the carotid wall and IMT of both CCA and carotid bulb were  performed in all patients. RESULTS Essential hypertension was associated with  decreased BRS (r =-0.53, P<0.001). We found out that there was no significant  difference between BRS and IMT CCA values in mild treated hypertensives and those  in SHNBP. This finding was independent of age-dependent decrease of BRS. SHNBP  and hypertensives with critical value BRS</=5 ms/mmHg have significantly  increased IMT CCA. CONCLUSIONS Decreased BRS is an early sign of autonomic  dysfunction even in prehypertensive period. SHNBP and hypertensives with  BRS</=5ms/mmHg have significantly increased IMT CCA. The principal result of this  study showed that BRS and carotid IMT in relatively low-risk hypertensives and  SHNBP could identify subjects at higher cardiovascular risk."|"brs,imt,shnbp,hypertensives,carotid"|"brs,imt,hypertensives,shnbp,carotid" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: An excess morning blood pressure surge (MBPS) may portend an increased  cardiovascular risk, but the mechanisms thereof have been little investigated.  The link between MBPS, short-term blood pressure (BP) variability, and arterial  stiffness has not been entirely defined. METHODS: In 602 consecutive untreated  hypertensive patients (48 +/- 12 years, 61% men, office BP 149/93 +/- 17/10  mmHg), we measured carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV, SphygmoCor) and  24-h ambulatory BP. Using self-reported sleep and wake times, MBPS was defined as  sleep-trough (ST-MBPS), prewaking, rising. Short-term BP variability was  calculated as weighted 24-h SBP SD and average real variability of 24-h SBP  (ARV), that is, average of absolute differences between consecutive SBP readings.  RESULTS: ST-MBPS (r = 0.16, P < 0.001) and rising MBPS (r = 0.12, P = 0.003)  showed a direct correlation with cf-PWV, whereas prewaking MBPS had no such  relation (r = 0.06, P = 0.14). Only ST-MBPS was independently associated with  cf-PWV (t = 1.96, P = 0.04) after adjustment for age, sex, height, office mean  arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal function. This association was lost  after further adjustment for weighted 24-h SBP SD (P = 0.13) or ARV (P = 0.24).  ARV was a significant mediator of the relationship between ST-MBPS and cf-PWV (P   = 0.003). CONCLUSION: In untreated hypertension, ST-MBPS has a direct relation  with aortic stiffness, which is mediated by an increased ARV. The adverse effects  of MBPS may be partly explained by its link with arterial stiffness, mediated by   short-term SBP variability."|"mbps,pwv,st,cf,pressure"|"mbps,24,sbp,st,arv" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prostasin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored serine protease   that is released in urine and is involved in epithelial Na channel activation. A   direct association between urinary prostasin (u-prostasin) concentration and  activation of the aldosterone-driven pathway has been suggested; however, in  previous studies on primary aldosteronism, a semiquantitative evaluation, rather   than a precise quantification, of prostasin was performed. We aim to investigate   if u-prostasin concentrations are higher in patients with primary aldosteronism  than in patients with essential hypertension and whether u-prostasin measurements  could be a useful marker for diagnosing primary aldosteronism in hypertensive  patients. METHODS: A total of 62 primary aldosteronism and 56 essential  hypertension patients were enrolled. Biochemical and hormonal parameters were  measured by applying routine laboratory methods, and u-prostasin levels were  assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: Primary aldosteronism patients had higher u-prostasin  levels than did essential hypertension patients. Prostasin levels were positively  correlated with the aldosterone-to-renin ratio and inversely correlated with  plasma K and urinary Na levels. In the highest concentration quartile,  u-prostasin levels were associated with a several-fold higher probability of  primary aldosteronism diagnosis in hypertensive patients. Receiver operating  characteristic curve analysis showed that prostasin was specific but poorly  sensitive as a diagnostic marker for primary aldosteronism. CONCLUSIONS: The  study shows that an elevated u-prostasin concentration in humans is a specific  marker for primary aldosteronism, which involves the classical model of  epithelial Na channel activation. There was no statistically significant  difference in prostasin concentrations among patients with different primary  aldosteronism subtypes. Studies with a larger series of patients are necessary to  clarify the clinical usefulness of the prostasin assay.  bDepartment of Pathology and Diagnostics, Section Clinical Chemistry, University   of Verona, Verona, Italy."|"prostasin,aldosteronism,primary,patients,levels"|"prostasin,aldosteronism,patients,primary,levels" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to investigate in the hypertensive  population the possible differential association between increased aortic and/or   carotid stiffness and organ damage in multiple districts, such as the kidney, the  vessels, and the heart. METHODS: In 314 essential hypertensive patients,  carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV, by applanation tonometry) and carotid  stiffness (from ultrasound images analysis), together with left ventricular  hypertrophy, carotid intima-media thickness, urinary albumin-creatinin ratio, and  glomerular filtration rate were measured. Increased cfPWV and carotid stiffness  were defined according to either international reference values or the 90th  percentile of a local control group (110 age and sex-matched healthy  individuals). RESULTS: When considering the 90th percentile of a local control  group, increased cfPWV was associated with reduced glomerular filtration rate,  either when carotid stiffness was increased [odds ratio (OR) 13.27 (confidence  limits (CL) 95% 3.86-45.58)] or not [OR 7.39 (CL95% 2.25-24.28)], whereas  increased carotid stiffness was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy,  either when cfPWV was increased [OR 2.86 (CL95% 1.15-7.09)] or not [OR 2.81  (CL95% 1.13-6.97)]. No association between increased cfPWV or carotid stiffness  and target organ damage was found when cutoffs obtained by international  reference values were used. The concomitance of both increased cfPWV and carotid   stiffness did not have an additive effect on organ damage. CONCLUSION: Aortic and  carotid stiffness are differentially associated with target organ damage in  hypertensive patients. Regional arterial stiffness as assessed by cfPWV is  associated with renal organ damage and local carotid stiffness with cardiac organ  damage."|"carotid,stiffness,cfpwv,increased,damage"|"carotid,stiffness,increased,cfpwv,damage" 
"AB  - It is known that iron overload may lead to an increased risk for many diseases.  According to GWAS studies, iron regulatory protein HFE gene variant H63D  (rs1799945) was associated with hypertension, an observation which we were able  to confirm also in our TAMRISK cohort. Thus, it is possible that abnormalities in  iron homeostasis may predispose to hypertension. This prompted us to study  whether there is an association between hypertension and another iron  overload-associated gene, hemojuvelin (HJV), which has 2 common polymorphic sites  (rs 16827043, rs7536827).The study included 336 hypertensive cases and 480  controls. All participants were 50- year-old Finnish men and women, and the data   was collected from the Tampere adult population cardiovascular risk study  (TAMRISK). Genotypes were determined using Competitive Allelic Specific PCR  (KASP).We found that the minor variant of the HJV polymorphic site rs16827043  (G-allele) is a statistically significant factor associated with hypertension  among 50 year-old individuals compared with the AA genotype carriers (OR = 1.66,   95% CI: 1.06 - 2.60, P = 0.03). The risk was even higher when overweight subjects  (BMI>30) were excluded from the analyses. For the other polymorphic variant  rs7536827, association with hypertension was found only among normal or slightly   overweight A-allele carriers.In conclusion, HJV genetic variants were associated   with essential hypertension in Finnish subjects from the TAMRISK cohort. Previous  studies together with the present one indicate that individuals with possible  dysregulation of iron metabolism may have higher risk for hypertension than those  with normal iron homeostasis."|"hypertension,iron,risk,associated,tamrisk"|"hypertension,iron,associated,risk,hjv" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the potential role of gut microbiome in metabolic diseases   has been revealed, especially in cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is one of   the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide, yet whether gut microbiota   dysbiosis participates in the development of hypertension remains largely  unknown. To investigate this issue, we carried out comprehensive metagenomic and   metabolomic analyses in a cohort of 41 healthy controls, 56 subjects with  pre-hypertension, 99 individuals with primary hypertension, and performed fecal  microbiota transplantation from patients to germ-free mice. RESULTS: Compared to   the healthy controls, we found dramatically decreased microbial richness and  diversity, Prevotella-dominated gut enterotype, distinct metagenomic composition   with reduced bacteria associated with healthy status and overgrowth of bacteria  such as Prevotella and Klebsiella, and disease-linked microbial function in both   pre-hypertensive and hypertensive populations. Unexpectedly, the microbiome  characteristic in pre-hypertension group was quite similar to that in  hypertension. The metabolism changes of host with pre-hypertension or  hypertension were identified to be closely linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis.  And a disease classifier based on microbiota and metabolites was constructed to  discriminate pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals from controls  accurately. Furthermore, by fecal transplantation from hypertensive human donors   to germ-free mice, elevated blood pressure was observed to be transferrable  through microbiota, and the direct influence of gut microbiota on blood pressure   of the host was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results describe a novel   causal role of aberrant gut microbiota in contributing to the pathogenesis of  hypertension. And the significance of early intervention for pre-hypertension was  emphasized."|"hypertension,gut,microbiota,pre,microbiome"|"hypertension,gut,microbiota,pre,hypertensive" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate whether genetic  polymorphisms of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway are  involved in the molecular basis of essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: A total   of 2160 unrelated Russian individuals comprising 1341 EH patients and 819 healthy  controls were recruited into the study. Seven common AHR pathway  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs2066853, rs2292596, rs2228099,  rs1048943, rs762551, rs1056836, and rs1800566 were genotyped by TaqMan-based  allele discrimination assays. RESULTS: We found that SNP rs2228099 of ARNT is  associated with an increased risk of EH (odds ratio=1.20 95% confidence interval:  1.01-1.44, P=0.043) in a dominant genetic model, whereas polymorphism rs762551 of  CYP1A2 showed an association with a decreased risk of disease in a recessive  genetic model (odds ratio=0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.89, P=0.006). A  log-likelihood ratio test enabled identification of epistatic interaction effects  on EH susceptibility for all SNPs. MB-MDR analysis showed that cigarette smoking,  rs1048943, rs762551, rs1056836, and rs2228099 were significant contributing  factors in 19, 18, 13, 13, and 11 interaction models, respectively. The best MDR   model associated with EH risk included rs1048943, rs762551, rs1056836, and  cigarette smoking (cross-validation consistency 100%, prediction error 45.7%,  Ppermutation<0.0001). The mRNA expression and in-silico function prediction  analyses have confirmed a regulatory potential for a majority of SNPs associated   with EH susceptibility. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study was the first to show that  gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the AHR signaling pathway  represent important determinants for the development of EH, and the pathway may  become an attractive target for a pharmacological intervention in hypertensive  patients in the future."|"eh,pathway,rs762551,study,snps"|"eh,pathway,rs762551,ahr,associated" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antihypertensive therapy is effective to control blood pressure (BP)   and to prevent cardiovascular events, but the further treatment strategies for  patients who cannot achieve goal BP with low-dose monotherapy is still under  dispute. Our study investigates the effects of high-dose amlodipine and valsartan  and their low-dose combination on blood pressure variability (BPV) and pulse wave  velocity (PWV) to provide references for clinical medication. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomized, parallel, case-controlled  trial performed in a medical center. A total of 134 outpatients newly diagnosed  with essential hypertension or receiving low-dose monotherapy were enrolled and  119 completed the trial. They were randomized into amlodipine 10mg group (n =  40), valsartan 160mg group (n = 38) and amlodipine 5mg + valsartan 80mg (n = 41)   in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio for a 10-week treatment. Demographic data and  laboratory indicators were collected at the randomization and 10 weeks after the   treatment. The 24-hour ambulatory BP and brachial-ankle PWV were also monitored.   RESULTS: All therapies reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < 0.05). The 24-hour   systolic BPV was significantly decreased in amlodipine and combination groups  (3.55 +/- 2.57, 4.11 +/- 2.20 versus 2.23 +/- 2.54mmHg, P < 0.05). The effects on  diastolic BPV differed between different treatments. PWV was lowered by 3  antihypertensive schemes; the degree of which from strongest to weakest were  valsartan, combination and amlodipine (228.87 +/- 60.41 versus 152.49 +/- 49.25  versus 99.35 +/- 35.57cm/second, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: All further strategies  can effectively control BP. The combination treatment reduces both BPV and PWV  noticeably, whereas double-dose amlodipine achieves the greatest BPV decrease and  valsartan is best in controlling PWV."|"pwv,bp,bpv,dose,treatment"|"amlodipine,bp,bpv,dose,pwv" 
"AB  - BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Essential Hypertension (EH) is a common disorder associated  with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Malaysia. To investigate  how genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS)  influence EH control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs (ACEI).  METHODS: A case-control, cross-sectional population-based nested study (n = 142)   included hypertensive subjects treated with ACEI drugs, either lisinopril or  enalapril (20 mg, once daily) as monotherapy for 24 weeks. In total seven  possible polymorphisms of RAS genes were genotyped. The association between those  polymorphisms and the changes in blood pressure were observed in the 24 week  treatment. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations of I, G, T, M and G  alleles of ACE (I/D, G2350A), AGT (M235T, T175M and G-6A) respectively were  observed in essential hypertensive subjects. The decrease in systolic blood  pressure and diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment of the patients  carrying II, GG, and TT genotypes were greater than the groups carrying DD, AA,  MM, MM and GG of I/D, G2350A, M235T, T174M and G-6A genotypes respectively. In  contrast, No significant difference was observed between renin gene polymorphisms  (Bg/I and MboI) and hypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study shows a  possible association of polymorphisms of RAS genes with the risk of non-control  of HT in ACEI-treated patients and indicates the importance of all this system's   components in regulating HT, it needs to be replicated in other data sources."|"polymorphisms,control,acei,observed,eh"|"polymorphisms,24,acei,blood,control" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally believed that essential hypertension is influenced by  both genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interactions. Tissue  kallikrein encoded by the tissue kallikrein gene (KLK1) is a key serine  proteinase of kallikrein-kinin system, which is capable of generating potent  vasactive peptides, kinins, by selective cleavage of the kininogen substrate. It   was reported that the A2233 --> C polymorphism in KLK1 gene is associated with  essential hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine whether the  molecular variations of KLK1 play role in determining the therapeutic response to  benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. METHODS: A total of 331 hypertensive individuals  were recruited and treated with benazepril for 15 days. A variant impact of KLK1   A2233C was revealed. Chi-square analysis showed that the hypertensive subjects  with the mutation genotype (AC + CC) had a higher proportion in systolic blood  pressure (SBP, 88.1% vs. 79.0%, chi(2) = 4.141, p = 0.042) and diastolic blood  pressure (DBP, 91.1% vs. 79.2%, chi(2) = 9.336, p = 0.002), respectively, to  benazepril medication in good responders than in poor responders. Logistic  regression analysis indicated that the hypertensive subjects with AC + CC  genotype were more sensitive to the benazepril therapy in SBP (OR=1.97, 95% CI:  1.02-3.80, p = 0.044) and DBP (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 2.69-5.16, p = 0.003), as  compared with those hypertensive subjects with AA genotype. CONCLUSION: Our  findings suggest that the A2233C polymorphism of KLK1 may be a marker of  evaluation of hypertensive subjects' responses to angiotensin I converting enzyme  inhibitors benazepril."|"klk1,benazepril,hypertensive,subjects,genotype"|"benazepril,hypertensive,klk1,subjects,chi" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CYP4A11  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), additional gene-gene and gene-environment   interactions on essential hypertension (EH) risk. METHODS: A total of 1648  participants (788 males, 860 females), with a mean age of 56.1 +/- 14.1 years  old, were selected, including 820 EH patients and 828 normotension subjects.  Logistic regression was performed to investigate association of SNPs within  CYP4A11 gene with high DBP, high SBP and EH risk, and generalized multifactor  dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the gene-gene interaction and  gene-smoking interaction. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that EH  risk was significantly higher in carriers of C allele of the rs1126742  polymorphism than those with TT genotype (TC+CC versus TT, adjusted OR (95%CI) =   1.56 (1.24-1.91). In addition, we also found that EH risk was also significantly   higher in carriers of G allele of the rs3890011polymorphism than those with CC  genotype (CG+ GG versus CC, adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.31 (1.15-2.03). GMDR analysis  indicated a potential gene-gene interaction between rs1126742 and rs3890011 and a  gene-environment interaction between rs1126742 and smoking. We found that  subjects with TC or CC of rs1126742 and CG or GG of rs3890011genotype have the  highest EH risk, OR (95%CI) was 2.52 (1.28-3.57). Smokers with TC or CC of  rs1126742 genotype have the highest EH risk, OR (95%CI) was 2.20 (1.28-3.40).  CONCLUSIONS: Gene-gene interaction between rs1126742 and rs3890011 and  gene-environment interaction between rs1126742 and smoking were associated with  increased EH risk."|"eh,risk,gene,rs1126742,cc"|"gene,eh,risk,rs1126742,interaction" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between serum homocysteine (Hcy)  concentration and T-cell subsets from patients with essential hypertension.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 218 essential hypertension patients were  recruited, of which 170 were H-type essential hypertensive and 48 were non-H-type  essential hypertensive. H-type essential hypertensive patients were divided into   three groups by concentration of serum Hcy. The peripheral blood T-cell subsets  (CD3(+)%, CD4(+)%, CD8(+) T%, CD4(+)/CD8(+)) and clinical features including age,  sex, serum creatinine, uric acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were recorded  and analyzed with T-cell subsets which were counted by fluorescence activated  cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with non-H-type hypertensive patients, CD4(+) T-cell  percentage in peripheral blood was significantly decreased in H-type hypertensive  patients. Because of the increase of Hcy level, CD4(+) T-cell percentage  decreased. Linear regression analysis showed that Hcy level was negatively  correlated with CD4(+) T-cell percentage; however, it was positively correlated  with CD3(+) T-cell percentage. CONCLUSION: A direct association between serum Hcy  concentrations and T-cell percentage was observed in patients with essential  hypertension. This observation indicates that T-cell subsets might play an  important role in hypertension."|"cell,hcy,patients,subsets,serum"|"cell,patients,essential,cd4,hcy" 
"AB  - Numerous studies demonstrated an importance of cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase  pathway of arachidonic acids metabolism for the pathogenesis of essential  hypertension (EH). The present study was designed to investigate whether common  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of CYP2C gene subfamily such as CYP2C8  (rs7909236 and rs1934953), CYP2C9 (rs9332242), and CYP2C19 (rs4244285) are  associated with susceptibility to EH in Russian population. A total of 816  unrelated Russian individuals comprising 425 EH patients and 391 normotensive  controls were included into the study. Genotyping of SNPs was performed using the  MassARRAY 4 system. SNP rs7909236 of CYP2C8 was significantly associated with  increased risk of EH (OR adjusted for sex and age was 2.99 95% CI 1.39-6.44, P =   0.005). SNPs rs1934953 CYP2C8 and rs4244285 of CYP2C19 showed association with EH  risk but at a borderline statistical significance (P </= 0.04). Combination of  genotypes CYP2C8 rs7909236 TT and CYP2C19 rs4244285 GG was associated with  increased EH risk (OR 3.34 95%CI 1.48-7.51, P = 0.004). Genotype-phenotype  correlation analysis showed that the levels of CYP2C8 mRNA were significantly  correlated with SNP rs7909236 (P = 0.01). in silico functional prediction  analysis revealed the functionality of majority of investigated SNPs. Thus, genes  of CYP2C subfamily are important genetic determinants of susceptibility to  essential hypertension in Russians."|"eh,cyp2c8,rs7909236,snps,snp"|"eh,cyp2c8,rs7909236,associated,cyp2c19" 
"AB  - Elevated serum leptin concentrations are closely related to sympathetic nervous  system activation in essential hypertension (EH); however, it is not clear  whether or not they are associated with parasympathetic nervous system impairment  in EH. Heart rate recovery (HRR) is a reproducible method used to assess  parasympathetic activity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship  between serum leptin and HRR in Chinese untreated EH patients. This was a  cross-sectional study enrolling 471 Chinese EH patients (205 men, 266 women; mean  age 63.1 years). HRR was calculated during an incremental cardiopulmonary  exercise test. Simple and multiple regression analyses were used to assess the  correlation between serum leptin level and HRR value. Serum leptin levels  elevated with increasing BP values. Moreover, univariate analysis revealed that  the HRR value was negatively correlated with serum leptin (r = -0.037, P < 0.01).  In multiple regression analysis, the age-adjusted serum leptin level was  negatively correlated with HRR (beta = -0.268, P < 0.01). Serum leptin remained  negatively associated with HRR (beta = -0.017, P < 0.01) after further  adjustments for factors including age, systolic blood pressure, total  cholesterol, and several factors that correlated with HRR. Our fi ndings  demonstrated that a raised serum leptin concentration is related to HRR blunt,  which suggests that the role of leptin in the development of EH might be  associated with impairment of the parasympathetic nervous system as well."|"hrr,leptin,serum,eh,age"|"hrr,leptin,serum,eh,01"

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels may be associated with essential  hypertension (EH). However, the results of previous studies on this association  are inconsistent. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we performed a systematic  literature search of the Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for  the relevant articles dated up to March 2016. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and  corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the estimates.  RESULTS: We included 11 studies with a total of 16,571 participants (4,830 EH  cases). We found that elevated Hcy levels were associated with the risk of EH  (pooled OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02-1.80 in the random-effects model). However,  subsequent subgroup analyses showed that elevated Hcy levels increased the EH  risk in retrospective studies (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.53-2.16; p < 0.001) and  unadjusted studies (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.43-2.07; p < 0.001), but not in  perspective studies (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.73-1.28; p = 0.939) and adjusted studies  (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.85-1.72; p = 0.297). No significant publication bias was  found (p = 0.876 for Begg's test, p = 0.144 for Egger's test). CONCLUSION: Plasma  Hcy levels are associated with EH risk. However, our findings do not support a  causal association between Hcy levels and EH."|"eh,hcy,levels,studies,however"|"95,eh,studies,ci,hcy" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of microRNAs (miRs,miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of  cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, as well as their diagnostic  potential, has recently attracted much attention. However, target-organ damage  (TOD) of hypertension remains a substantial challenge due to the lack of specific  biomarkers. The present study was undertaken to identify and validate the  potential of circulating miRs as novel biomarkers for TOD. METHODS: We assessed  the expression levels of miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c in 54 patients with  untreated essential hypertension and 30 healthy individuals. All patients  underwent two-dimensional echocardiography, office, and ambulatory blood pressure  monitoring. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate the expression of selected miRs. The expression  level of miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c correlations between blood pressure and  echocardiography parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation  coefficient. RESULTS: We observed higher expression levels of miR-29a (31.50 +/-   3.90 vs 26.55 +/- 1.74; p < 0.001), miR-29b (32.31 +/- 2.85vs 27.21 +/- 1.59; p <  0.001), and miR-29c (31.13 +/- 3.42 vs 25.96 +/- 1.88; p < 0.001) in hypertensive  patients compared with healthy control individuals. In hypertension patients, 25   patients were left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), miR-29a (32.82 +/- 4.06 vs  30.07 +/- 3.68; p = 0.012), miR-29b (33.27 +/- 2.84 vs 30.71 +/- 3.04; p = 0.02),  and miR-29c (32.33 +/- 3.52 vs 29.55 +/- 3.46; p = 0.005) in LVH patients  compared with nLVH patients. We found miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c expression  levels showed significant positive correlations with office SBP (p = 0.579, p <  0.001; r = 0.576, p < 0.001; r = 0.598, p < 0.001), office DBP (p = 0.243, p =  0.026; r = 0.304, p = 0.005; r = 0.287, p = 0.008), office PP(r = 0.49, p <  0.001; r = 0.442, p < 0.001; r = 0.479, p < 0.001), 24 h mean SBP(p = 0.511, p <   0.001; r = 0.6, p < 0.001; r = 0.533, p < 0.001), 24 h mean DBP (p = 0. 304, p =   0.005; r = 0.283, p = 0.009; r = 0.340, p = 0.002), and 24 h mean PP (p = 0.385,   p < 0.001; r = 0. 506, p < 0.001; r = 0.386, p < 0.001), respectively. The  expression levels of miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c were positively related to  LVMI (r = 0.65, p < 0.001; r = 0.715, p < 0.001; r = 0.654, p < 0.001),  respectively.

"AB  - The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene plays an important role in  regulating vascular tone and blood pressure. Recently, the eNOS G894T and T-786C   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were intensively studied with regard to  their associations with hypertension. However, the results of these studies were   inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted the so far largest meta-analysis to better   assess the correlations between eNOS SNPs and hypertension. Eligible articles  were searched in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and CNKI up to April 2016. Odds  ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to detect any potential  associations between eNOS SNPs and the risk of hypertension. A total of 95  case-control studies involving 29,308 hypertension cases and 33,950 healthy  controls were analyzed. The overall meta-analysis results showed that eNOS G894T   and T-786C SNPs were both significantly associated with the risk of hypertension,  the T allele of G894T SNP (G versus T, P < 0.00001, OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.89)   and C allele of T-786C SNP (T versus C, P = 0.004, OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.97)  conferred an increased susceptibility to hypertension. Further subgroup analyses   yielded similar positive results for G894T SNP in essential hypertension,  gestational hypertension, and Asian ethnicity, and that for T-786C SNP in  essential hypertension and Asian population. Overall, our findings suggest that  eNOS G894T and T-786C SNPs were both significantly correlated with hypertension.   Additionally, the T allele of G894T SNP and C allele of T-786C SNP may serve as  potential biological markers for hypertension susceptibility in Asians."|"hypertension,enos,g894t,snps,c"|"hypertension,786c,enos,g894t,snp" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hyperuricemia (HU) on subclinical changes of  left ventricle (LV) function and structure in patients with hypertension (HT)  using three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) and to explore   the relationships between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and three-dimensional  speckle tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) parameters in hypertensive and  nonhypertensive patients with HU. METHODS: Four age- and sex-matched groups were   studied: I: healthy controls, HT- HU- (n = 40); II: HT- HU+ (n = 40); III: HT+  HU- (n = 40); IV: HT+ HU+ (n = 44). Conventional echocardiography and 3DSTE were   recorded. Relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricular mass index assessed   by M-mode echocardiography (LVMi-M) were calculated. 3DSTE parameters including  LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF), LVMi-3D, global longitudinal strain (GLS),  and global circumferential strain (GCS) were compared. The relationships between   SUA levels and 3DSTE parameters were investigated. RESULTS: Despite LV diameters,  LV volumes and EF were similar among groups (all p > 0.05), GLS decreased and  LVMi-3D increased from controls (group I) to patients with HU or HT alone (group   II or III), and patients with both HU and HT (group IV) (all p < 0.05). SUA  levels were significantly correlated with the absolute value of GLS (r = -0.461,   p < 0.05) and LVMi-3D (r = 0.504, p < 0.05) in hypertensive and nonhypertensive  patients with HU. CONCLUSIONS: HU may exacerbate LV systolic dysfunction and  remodeling in hypertensive patients, which can be detected by 3DSTE. Early uric  acid lowing treatment may be beneficial for hypertensive patients with HU.

"AB  - Several recent studies showed that C825T polymorphism is related to  cardiovascular diseases in normal population. However, studies on whether 825T  allele influences the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in hypertensive  patients are rare. In the current study, 729 patients (CC, n = 332; CT, n = 313;   TT, n = 84) with essential hypertension were genotyped for C825T polymorphism of   the GNB3 gene and followed 8 years for major adverse cardiovascular events  (MACEs) which include stroke, the onset of coronary artery disease (CAD), and  all-cause death. Established cardiovascular risk factors were used to adjust the   multivariate Cox analysis. After a mean follow-up period of 7.60 +/- 1.12 years,   a significantly higher incidence of MACEs was seen in the TT genotype group than   CC and CT genotypes. The TT variant was significantly and independently  predictive of MACEs (relative risk = 2.574; p < 0.001), CAD (relative risk =  2.963; p < 0.001), but not stroke, CAD+stroke or death.

"AB  - The aim of this study was to compare 80 mg telmisartan/5 mg amlodipine/12.5 mg  hydrochlorothiazide (T80/A5/H12.5) with 80 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg  hydrochlorothiazide (T80/H12.5) to determine their relative blood pressure (BP)  lowering effects in essential hypertensive patients with inadequate control and  to evaluate the long-term safety of T80/A5/H12.5 in a 52-week extension period.  Patients (n=132) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with  T80/A5/H12.5 or T80/H12.5 for 8 weeks after a 6-week run-in-period of T80/H12.5.   All 126 patients who completed the double-blind period entered the 52-week  open-label extension and received T80/A5/H12.5. The adjusted mean changes from  the reference baseline of the trough-seated systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP)  at week 8 were significantly larger in the T80/A5/H12.5 group (-10.6/-8.8 mm Hg)   than in the T80/H12.5 group (-2.3/-1.3 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). The BP-lowering effect   of T80/A5/H12.5 was maintained over the 52-week extension period. The adverse  events (AEs) during both treatment periods were generally mild. Drug-related AEs   were reported in one patient in each group in the double-blind period and in five  patients exposed to T80/A5/H12.5 in the double-blind and/or open-label extension   period. T80/A5/H12.5 therapy was clinically and statistically superior to  T80/H12.5 therapy for the reduction of BP in patients with essential hypertension  uncontrolled with T80/H12.5, and its BP-lowering effect was maintained in the  long term. T80/A5/H12.5 was generally well-tolerated."|"t80,h12,a5,bp,patients"|"h12,t80,a5,period,bp" 
"AB  - We evaluated whether vascular remodeling is present in physiological aging and  whether hypertension accelerates the aging process for vascular function and  structure. Small arteries from 42 essential hypertensive patients (HT) and 41  normotensive individuals (NT) were dissected after subcutaneous biopsy.  Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (pressurized myograph) was assessed by  acetylcholine, repeated under the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor  N-nitro-l-arginine methylester or the antioxidant tempol. Structure was evaluated  by media-lumen ratio (M/L). Intravascular oxidative generation and collagen  deposition were assessed. Inhibition by N-nitro-l-arginine methylester on ACh was  inversely related to age in both groups (P<0.0001) and blunted in HT versus NT  for each age range. In NT, tempol enhanced endothelial function in the oldest  subgroup; in HT, the potentiating effect started earlier. HT showed an increased   M/L (P<0.001) versus control. In both groups, M/L was directly related to age  (P<0.0001). M/L was greater in HT, starting from 31 to 45 years range. A  significant age-hypertension interaction occurred (P=0.0009). In NT,  intravascular superoxide emerged in the oldest subgroup, whereas it appeared  earlier among HT. Among NT, aged group displayed an increment of collagen fibers   versus young group. In HT, collagen deposition was already evident in youngest,  with a further enhancement in the aged group. In small arteries, ageing shows a  eutrophic vascular remodeling and a reduced nitric oxide availability. Oxidative   stress and fibrosis emerge in advanced age. In HT, nitric oxide availability is  early reduced, but the progression rate with age is similar. Structural  alterations include wide collagen deposition and intravascular reactive oxygen  species, and the progression rate with age is steeper."|"ht,age,nt,collagen,intravascular"|"ht,age,nt,collagen,deposition" 
"AB  - Objective The management of blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients is the  key to preventing a progression of organ damage. The brachial BP (bBP) has been  used as the representative method for measuring the BP. The central BP (cBP),  which is, different from the bBP due to the propagation and the reflection of the  pulse wave in the arterial system, has recently received attention because it can  now be estimated non-invasively. We examined the relationships between the  difference in the central systolic BP (csBP) and the brachial systolic BP (bsBP)   (Delta) and other factors in hypertensive patients. Methods The bsBP and csBP  were measured in patients with essential hypertension and the relationships  between the bsBP, csBP, or Delta and background factors including age, the brain   natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),  flow-mediated vasodilation (an index of vascular endothelial function), the  cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI, an index of arteriosclerosis), and the carotid  intima-media thickness (an index of atherosis) were investigated. Results The  data of 191 patients were analyzed. Although there was no significant correlation  between the CAVI and the bsBP; positive correlations were observed between the  CAVI and the csBP (r=0.249, p=0.001). The Delta value showed significant positive  correlations with age, and the BNP, eGFR, and CAVI values. Conclusion The csBP is  more strongly associated with arteriosclerosis than the bsBP. Moreover, the Delta  value is more strongly associated with cardiac function, renal function, and  arteriosclerosis than the bsBP or csBP. These data suggested that the Delta value  may have a greater prognostic value than the bsBP or csBP and may be worth  calculating in the clinical setting."|"csbp,bsbp,bp,delta,patients"|"bsbp,csbp,bp,delta,cavi" 
"AB  - Prescription of multiple antihypertensive medications for the treatment of  essential hypertension (HTN) has been well described in adults but not in  children and adolescents. The authors describe the frequency with which children   with essential HTN are prescribed a single vs two or more concomitantly  administered antihypertensive medications. They also describe demographic  features and comorbidities associated with the prescription of a single vs  multiple antihypertensive medications. Multiple antihypertensive medication use  in the management of pediatric HTN, as in the management of adult HTN, is not  uncommon. In this single-center, retrospective study of 113 children with  essential HTN, 28% of children were concomitantly prescribed two or more  antihypertensive medications for poorly controlled blood pressure following  prescription of a single medication. Demographic and comorbid conditions  associated with the prescription of more than one antihypertensive medication  include advanced hypertensive stage, race, and a family history of HTN."|"htn,antihypertensive,single,medications,medication"|"antihypertensive,htn,children,medications,prescription" 
"AB  - An association between androgenic alopecia (AGA), coronary artery disease, and  hypertension has been reported in previous epidemiological studies. The authors  evaluated the relationship of target organ damage caused by hypertension with AGA  in 101 newly diagnosed and untreated hypertension men with mild to moderate AGA  (AGAm ), severe AGA (AGAs ), and non-AGA. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), office and  24-hour pulse pressure (PP), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), coronary flow reserve (CFRd), and AGA severity by   Hamilton-Norwood scale were estimated. CFRd was significantly impaired in AGAs  patients compared with AGAm (P=.007) and non-AGA patients (P=.02). No differences  were found within groups regarding PWV, PP, IMT, and LVH. AGA severity was  related to CFRd (independently) and PP while AGA duration and age of onset were  related to CFRd and PP, respectively. The authors conclude that impaired coronary  microcirculation and aortic stiffness might precede the appearance of significant  stenotic coronary lesions in hypertensive patients with severe AGA. In addition,   hypertensive patients with severe and early AGA onset seem to be exposed to an  augmented cardiovascular risk."|"aga,coronary,pp,cfrd,hypertension"|"aga,cfrd,coronary,patients,pp" 
"AB  - Microalbuminuria is a risk factor for cardiovascular events and death in  hypertensive patients. Patients who are expected to increase albuminuria need  strict blood pressure control. In the present study, we assessed the association   between the renal resistive index (RI) and future increases in albuminuria in  patients with essential hypertension. Sixty-six patients with essential  hypertension were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic  regression analyses were used to identify the factors, including renal RI, that  were significant independent determinants of increased in urinary albumin  excretion (UAE), defined as an increase of >50% in the urinary  albumin-to-creatinine ratio over 2 years. Receiver operator characteristics curve  analysis was used to select the optimal cut-off point that predicted an increase   in UAE. RI was the only significant variable that predicted the increase in UAE,   with the optimal cut-off value of renal RI that predicted this increase being  0.71 (sensitivity 52.4% and specificity 84.4%). Renal RI is associated with the  future increase in albuminuria in patients with essential hypertension."|"increase,ri,renal,patients,used"|"increase,patients,ri,renal,albuminuria" 
"AB  - Despite the well-known role of cystathionine gamma-lyase (Cth) in cardiovascular   pathophysiology, transcriptional regulation of Cth remains incompletely  understood. Sequencing of the Cth promoter region in mouse models of  genetic/essential hypertension (viz. Blood Pressure High [BPH], Blood Pressure  Low [BPL] and Blood Pressure Normal [BPN] mice) identified several genetic  variations. Transient transfections of BPH/BPL-Cth promoter-reporter plasmids  into various cell types revealed higher promoter activity of BPL-Cth than that of  BPH-Cth. Corroboratively, endogenous Cth mRNA levels in kidney and liver tissues   were also elevated in BPL mice. Computational analysis of the polymorphic Cth  promoter region predicted differential binding affinity of c-Rel, HOXA3 and IRF1   with BPL/BPH-Cth promoter domains. Over-expression of c-Rel/HOXA3/IRF1 modulated   BPL/BPH-Cth promoter activities in a consistent manner. Gel shift assays using  BPH/BPL-Cth-promoter oligonucleotides with/without binding sites for  c-Rel/HOXA3/IRF1 displayed formation of specific complexes with c-Rel/HOXA3/IRF1;  addition of antibodies to reaction mixtures resulted in supershifts/inhibition of  Cth promoter-transcription factor complexes. Furthermore, chromatin  immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays proved differential binding of c-Rel, HOXA3 and  IRF1 with the polymorphic promoter region of BPL/BPH-Cth. Tumor necrosis  factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) reduced the activities of BPL/BPH-Cth promoters to  different extents that were further declined by ectopic expression of IRF1; on  the other hand, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of IRF1 rescued the  TNF-alpha-mediated suppression of the BPL/BPH-Cth promoter activities. In  corroboration, ChIP analysis revealed enhanced binding of IRF1 with BPH/BPL-Cth  promoter following TNF-alpha treatment. BPL/BPH-Cth promoter activity was  diminished upon exposure of hepatocytes and cardiomyoblasts to ischemia-like  pathological condition due to reduced binding of c-Rel with BPL/BPH-Cth-promoter.  Taken together, this study reveals the molecular basis for the differential  expression of Cth in mouse models of essential hypertension under basal and  pathophysiological conditions."|"cth,promoter,bpl,bph,irf1"|"cth,bpl,promoter,bph,irf1" 
"AB  - Norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves is removed from the neuroeffector  junction via the action of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). NET impairment  is evident in several clinically important conditions including major depressive   disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), essential hypertension and the postural  orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We aimed to determine whether a single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the NET gene  is associated with NET impairment and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. The  analyses were carried out in two cohorts of European ancestry, which included  healthy controls and MDD, PD, hypertensive and POTS patients. Compared with  controls, cases had significantly higher prevalence of the T allele of rs7194256   (C/T), arterial norepinephrine, depression and anxiety scores, larger left  ventricular mass index, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart   rate. Bioinformatic analysis identified that the microRNA miR-19a-3p could bind  preferentially to the sequence created by the presence of the T allele. This was   supported by results of luciferase assays. Compared with controls, cases had  significantly lower circulating miR-19a-3p, which was associated with pathways  related to blood pressure and regulation of neurotransmission. In vitro  norepinephrine downregulated miR-19a-3p. In conclusion, the T allele of the  rs7194256 SNP in the 3'UTR of the NET gene is more prevalent in diseases where  NET impairment is evident. This might be explained by the creation of a binding  site for the microRNA miR-19a-3p. A defect in NET function may potentiate the  sympathetic neurochemical signal, predisposing individuals with affective  diseases to increased risk of cardiovascular disease development."|"net,norepinephrine,allele,p,mir"|"net,19a,3p,mir,norepinephrine" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and pregnancy outcomes of superimposed  preeclampsia (PE) with or without proteinuria among women with chronic  hypertension. METHODS: This retrospective study included 142 women with essential  hypertension diagnosed at 20weeks of gestation, managed at a tertiary center.  They were divided into three groups (non-PE, PE with proteinuria, and PE without   proteinuria) to compare pregnancy outcomes. The non-PE group was further divided   into two subgroups (controlled and uncontrolled hypertension). RESULTS: There  were 87 women in the non-PE group, 47 in the PE with proteinuria group, and 8 in   the PE without proteinuria group. Median gestational age at delivery was  38.7weeks in the non-PE group, 30.4 in the PE with proteinuria group, and 28.4 in  the PE without proteinuria group. In three of the women in the PE without  proteinuria group, the diagnostic criteria were fulfilled by liver involvement  (complicated by thrombocytopenia in one woman). The remaining five women had  uteroplacental dysfunction. The 87 women in the non-PE group were divided into a   controlled hypertension subgroup of 75 women and uncontrolled hypertension  subgroup of 12. The median gestational age at delivery was 39.1weeks in the  controlled HT subgroup and 34.1weeks in the uncontrolled hypertension subgroup.  The pregnancy outcomes were significantly poorer in the latter group. CONCLUSION:  Pregnancy outcomes were unfavorable in both the PE without proteinuria and PE  with proteinuria groups. Women with non-PE uncontrolled hypertension also had  poor pregnancy outcomes, although their outcomes were better than those of women   with PE."|"women,pe,hypertension,group,outcomes"|"pe,group,proteinuria,women,hypertension" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is one of the most severe women's health problems. Modern   life brings more chances of pulmonary diseases to human. The purpose of the study  is to investigate weather pneumonia and lung cancer are associated with the  mortality of women with hypertension in different age. A cross-sectional  retrospective study was conducted in women with hypertension, who were admitted  into our hospital in 2004-2013. 14219 women were enrolled and 68.8 +/- 12.2 year   old (y). Isolated hypertension was 14.7%. The age of death was 78.1 +/- 9.8 y.  The mortality was 4.4% for average and 0.2%, 1.1%, 2.4%, 4.8%, 10.4% and 15.8% in  group age <==49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and >==90 y separately. This  mortality increased with age was positively significantly correlated with the  increased incidences of pneumonia (P < 0.05, r = 0.77). Pneumonia was a  significant risk associated with the mortality in age 55-89 y (OR = 6.4-22.5; 95%  CI = 3.06-51.12). While, lung cancer was the significant risk in 70-79 y. These  observations indicate that pneumonia and lung cancer are significant risk factors  associated with the mortality of certain age women with hypertension, and bring  an alert that pneumonia and lung cancer should be prevented and treated  intensively in modern life in order to reduce the mortality."|"hypertension,women,age,mortality,pneumonia"|"age,mortality,hypertension,pneumonia,women" 
"AB  - RATIONALE: Data from animal models of hypertension indicate that high blood  pressure may develop as a vital mechanism to maintain adequate blood flow to the   brain. We propose that congenital vascular variants of the posterior cerebral  circulation and cerebral hypoperfusion could partially explain the pathogenesis  of essential hypertension, which remains enigmatic in 95% of patients. OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the role of the cerebral circulation in the pathophysiology of  hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: We completed a series of retrospective and  mechanistic case-control magnetic resonance imaging and physiological studies in   normotensive and hypertensive humans (n=259). Interestingly, in humans with  hypertension, we report a higher prevalence of congenital cerebrovascular  variants; vertebral artery hypoplasia, and an incomplete posterior circle of  Willis, which were coupled with increased cerebral vascular resistance, reduced  cerebral blood flow, and a higher incidence of lacunar type infarcts. Causally,  cerebral vascular resistance was elevated before the onset of hypertension and  elevated sympathetic nerve activity (n=126). Interestingly, untreated  hypertensive patients (n=20) had a cerebral blood flow similar to age-matched  controls (n=28). However, participants receiving antihypertensive therapy (with  blood pressure controlled below target levels) had reduced cerebral perfusion  (n=19). Finally, elevated cerebral vascular resistance was a predictor of  hypertension, suggesting that it may be a novel prognostic or diagnostic marker  (n=126). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that congenital cerebrovascular variants   in the posterior circulation and the associated cerebral hypoperfusion may be a  factor in triggering hypertension. Therefore, lowering blood pressure may worsen   cerebral perfusion in susceptible individuals."|"cerebral,hypertension,blood,may,vascular"|"cerebral,hypertension,blood,vascular,circulation" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that circulating endothelial progenitor  cells (EPCs) number reflects the endogenous vascular repair ability, with the  EPCs pool declining in presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Several drugs,  including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, have been reported to elicit   antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as to improve vascular  remodeling and dysfunction. However, no data are available about the effects of  lercanidipine on EPCs. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate   the effects of short-term treatment with lercanidipine on circulating EPCs, as  well as on indices of inflammation and oxidative stress. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Twenty essential hypertensive patients were included in the study and treated for  4 weeks with lercanidipine 20 mg per day orally. Investigations were performed in  basal condition, after appropriate wash out of previous treatments, and after 4  weeks of lercanidipine treatment. Inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were   assessed by ELISA technique. Lin-/7AAD-/CD34+/CD133+/VEGFR-2 + and  Lin-/7AAD-/CD34+/VEGFR-2 + cells were identified by flow cytometry and considered  as EPCs. EPCs cells were expressed as number of cells per million Lin-mononuclear  cells. RESULTS: Circulating EPCs were significantly increased after lercanidipine  treatment (CD34+/CD133+/VEGFR-2 + cells: 78.3 +/- 64.5 vs 46.6 +/- 32.8;  CD34+/VEGFR-2+: 87996 +/- 165116 vs 1026 +/- 1559, respectively, p < 0.05). A  modest reduction in circulating indices of inflammation was also observed.  CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, lercanidipine is able to increase the number of  circulating EPCs, possibly through a reduction of low-grade inflammation."|"epcs,lercanidipine,circulating,cells,treatment"|"epcs,cells,lercanidipine,circulating,cd34" 
"AB  - The pupil is a suitable end organ for studying autonomic function because both  sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity can be evaluated independently  using a light stimulus. Sympathetic response elicited by physical stress is  augmented in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects, which  increases the risk of cardiovascular events. We used pupillometry to evaluate the  effects of the calcium channel blockers azelnidipine (AZ) and amlodipine (AM) on   changes in autonomic nervous activity induced by isometric exercise in patients  with hypertension. Twenty patients with essential hypertension who were  administered AM and 21 who were administered AZ underwent a pupillary function  test and blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) measurements before and after  isometric handgrip exercise (IHG). Maximal velocities of pupil constriction (VC)   and re-dilation (VD) obtained with light stimulation for 1 s were used as indices  of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity, respectively. Increases in  systolic BP and PR elicited by IHG were significantly smaller in the AZ group  than in the AM group. After IHG, both VC and VD significantly increased in the AM  group but not in the AZ group. The low-to-high frequency ratio obtained from  analysis of PR variability, another measure of sympathetic activity, also  increased in only the AM group. Thus AZ inhibited autonomic activation and  suppressed cardiovascular responses to IHG more effectively than AM. The  sympathoinhibitory effect of AZ may therefore be beneficial for patients with  essential hypertension. In addition, pupillometry was shown to be a useful tool  for assessing autonomic function in hypertensive patients."|"az,autonomic,ihg,sympathetic,activity"|"az,group,patients,activity,autonomic" 
"AB  - Aliskiren (Rasilez), a direct renin inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of   essential hypertension. A postmarketing prescription-event monitoring (PEM) study  was conducted in England to monitor the safety and utilization of aliskiren.  Summary statistics and event incidence densities were calculated. The cohort  consisted of 6385 individuals with a median age of 68 years (interquartile range,  59-76). Aliskiren was largely prescribed for its licensed indication of  hypertension (93.3%) and was reported as "effective" by the prescriber in 77.4%  of individuals. Frequently reported clinical events during treatment were  diarrhea (3.1% of on-treatment events), malaise/lassitude (3.0%), and  nausea/vomiting (1.2%), which were also common reasons for treatment cessation.  Renal events were rare, with 24 cases probably or possibly related to aliskiren  use, and four of which were classified as acute renal failure using RIFLE (Risk  Injury Failure Loss End-Stage Kidney Disease) criteria. These results should be  used in conjunction with other clinical and pharmacoepidemiologic studies to  optimize the safe prescribing of aliskiren."|"aliskiren,treatment,hypertension,renal,events"|"aliskiren,treatment,events,clinical,event" 
"AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system  (GITS)/candesartan cilexetil (N/C) combination was demonstrated to be an  effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in a short-term study. The  current study investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose  combination (FDC) of N/C therapy in moderate-to-severe essential hypertension.  METHODS: A multinational, 70-centre, open-label study of N/C treatment for 28 or   52 weeks at a target dose of N60 mg/C32 mg. The primary assessment included the  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Efficacy assessments  included change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 508 patients were enrolled, with 417 (82.1%)  completing week 28 of treatment. Of these, 200 patients continued treatment, as  planned, to week 52, with 193 (96.5%) completing this period. At least one TEAE  or drug-related TEAE were reported in 76.8% and 45.3% patients up to week 28, and  in 80.7% and 46.9% up to week 52/end of study. Most TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs   to week 52 (93.9% and 95.4%, respectively) were mild or moderate in intensity.  Rates of drug-related serious AEs were low (0.6%). TEAE-related discontinuations   occurred in 10% patients before week 28 and in no additional patients thereafter.  N/C provided substantial, sustained reductions in mean systolic and diastolic BP   from baseline: 30.1 +/- 18.4 and 12.8 +/- 10.7 mmHg, respectively, at week 52.  WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Nifedipine GITS/candesartan cilexetil FDC at the  target dose of 60 mg/32 mg was well tolerated for a study duration up to 52 weeks  and provided sustained reductions in systolic and diastolic BP."|"week,study,patients,treatment,related"|"week,52,patients,study,28" 
"AB  - The amiloride-sensitive sodium channel beta subunit (SCNN1B) gene encodes the  beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel, which is involved in blood  pressure homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the  association between SCNN1B gene promoter methylation and essential hypertension  (EH), and to explore whether SCNN1B methylation was altered by antihypertensive  therapy. The present study recruited 282 individuals: 94 controls, 94 incident  cases and 94 prevalent cases. Subsequently, the methylation status of six CpG  sites in the SCNN1B promoter region was measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing  technology. Among the six CpG sites, a significant difference in CpG1 and CpG2  methylation levels were detected between controls and incident cases (CpG1:  betastandardized=0.17, adjusted P=0.015; CpG2: betastandardized=0.41, adjusted  P=0.001). In addition, a significant difference was detected in CpG1 methylation   levels between incident cases and prevalent cases (betastandardized=0.252,  adjusted P=3.77E04). The present study also demonstrated that CpG1 and CpG2  methylation levels were significantly lower in males compared with in females  (CpG1: t=3.180, P=0.002; CpG2: t=2.148, P=0.033). CpG1 methylation was also shown  to be positively correlated with age (controls: r=0.285, P=0.008; incident cases:  r=0.401, P=0.0001; prevalent cases: r=0.367, P=0.001). These results indicated a   significant association between EH and SCNN1B methylation, which was affected by   age, gender and antihypertensive therapy."|"methylation,scnn1b,cpg1,present,study"|"methylation,cases,cpg1,scnn1b,cpg2" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Apelin-APJ pathway has emerged as a potent regulator of blood  pressure (BP) and blood flow in vasculature and heart. Variants in apelin gene  may affect the vascular tone in peripheral circulation or heart, thereby  predisposing to cardiovascular diseases. The aim of our study was to investigate   the association of two apelin gene polymorphisms rs3761581 and rs2235312, and  apelin levels in patients with essential hypertension (EH) and acute coronary  syndrome (ACS). METHODS: The study comprised of three groups namely, (1) 118  healthy control subjects, (2) 92 EH patients, and (3) 60 ACS patients. DNA was  extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and genotyping was performed by  SNaPshot method. Plasma apelin 13 levels were estimated using ELISA. RESULTS: EH   and ACS patients had a significantly lower level of apelin 13, regardless of  gender (p=0.003, p=0.017, respectively). Interestingly, the female EH and ACS  patients had lower levels of apelin 13 than their male counterparts. The G allele  of rs3761581 was more apparent in patients especially in ACS than the controls.  CONCLUSION: Reduced apelin levels may enhance vasoconstriction to influence high   BP and heart's workload in EH and ACS. Genetic involvement of apelin needs to be   established in well-defined larger sample size."|"apelin,acs,eh,patients,levels"|"apelin,acs,patients,eh,levels" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), an extracranial structure, is  connected with the central nervous system (CNS) through sympathetic and  parasympathetic nerves. We hypothesized that SPG block through sympathetic nerves  anesthesia might decrease blood pressure (BP) in recently diagnosed and never  treated middle-aged patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: We performed  SBG block in 22 hypertensive patients (mean age 45+/-12years, 15 men). All  patients have been subjected to 24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring a  week prior the procedure as well as in a period of 21-30days after the SBG block   in order to estimate differences in 24h average systolic (24h SBP) and diastolic   blood pressure (24h DBP), daytime, nighttime, pre-awake and early morning SBP and  DBP as well as BP load. RESULTS: We found that 24h SBP (p=0.001) and 24h DBP  (p<0.001), daytime SBP and DBP (p<0.001) as well as daytime SBP and DBP load  (p=0.002 and p<0.001, respectively) were decreased in total population at  21-30days after SPG block. In 11/22 responders (24h SBP decrease >/=5mmHg), SBP  and DBP were reduced during overall 24h and daytime (p<0.001) and nighttime  periods (p=0.01 and p=0.06, respectively) while pre-awake SBP (p=0.09) along with  daytime SBP and DBP load (p=0.07 and p=0.06, respectively) were also almost  decreased. CONCLUSIONS: SBG block might be a promising, non-invasive, safe,  painless and easy to perform therapeutic option of BP decrease. As with renal  denervation, SBG should be effective in those hypertensive patients with an  activated SNS, so a period of patient selection should precede the application of  this procedure."|"patients,sbp,block,sbg,h"|"sbp,24h,dbp,001,block" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to compare the profiles of antibodies (IgM  and IgG) against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) of hematological  diseases. METHODS: The serum antibodies of oxLDL-IgM and oxLDL-IgG for 446 cases   with hematological diseases and 90 patients with primary hypertension and 90  healthy controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a   cross-section survey. The association of serum oxLDL-LgM and oxLDL-IgG with  hematological diseases was analyzed by multiple linear regression model. RESULTS:  Comparing with the hypertension or normal groups, the levels of TCH, TG, LDL-c,  HDL-c, oxLDL, and oxLDL-IgG were lower and the levels of ADP and oxLDL-IgM were  higher in the hematological diseases group. The levels of oxLDL-IgG antibodies  titer were different among hematological diseases group. The results of  correlation and multiple regression analysis showed that the seven hematological   disease subgroups were positively related to the oxLDL-IgM antibody titer but  negatively related to the oxLDL-IgG antibody titer, having been adjusted for  potential confounding factors such as age, SBP, DBP, BMI, TCH, TG, ADP, oxLDL,  HDL-c, LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that oxLDL-IgG antibodies titer were  lower and of oxLDL-IgM titer were higher than hypertension and healthy  individuals. Also oxLDL-IgG titer were different among hematological diseases  group."|"oxldl,igg,hematological,igm,diseases"|"oxldl,igg,hematological,diseases,titer" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Self-management of hypertension, including self-monitoring and  antihypertensive medication titration, lowers blood pressure (BP) at 1 year  compared to usual care. The aim of the current trial is to assess the  effectiveness of the Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure   (HOME BP) intervention for the self-management of hypertension in primary care.  METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HOME BP trial will be a randomised controlled trial  comparing BP self-management-consisting of the HOME BP online digital  intervention with self-monitoring, lifestyle advice and antihypertensive drug  titration-with usual care for people with uncontrolled essential hypertension.  Eligible patients will be recruited from primary care and randomised to usual  care or to self-management using HOME BP. The primary outcome will be the  difference in mean systolic BP (mm Hg) at 12-month follow-up between the  intervention and control groups adjusting for baseline BP and covariates.  Secondary outcomes (also adjusted for baseline and covariates where appropriate)   will be differences in mean BP at 6 months and diastolic BP at 12 months; patient  enablement; quality of life, and economic analyses including all key resources  associated with the intervention and related services, adopting a broad societal   perspective to include NHS, social care and patient costs, considered within  trial and modelled with a lifetime horizon.

"AB  - Inappropriate activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is a key  contributor to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. During RAS activation,  infiltration of immune cells into the kidney exacerbates hypertension and renal  injury. However, the mechanisms underpinning the accumulation of mononuclear  cells in the kidney after RAS stimulation remain unclear. C-C motif chemokine 5  (CCL5) drives recruitment of macrophages and T lymphocytes into injured tissues,   and we have found that RAS activation induces CCL5 expression in the kidney  during the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal fibrosis. We therefore  evaluated the contribution of CCL5 to renal damage and fibrosis in hypertensive  and normotensive models of RAS stimulation. Surprisingly, during angiotensin  II-induced hypertension, CCL5-deficient (knockout, KO) mice exhibited markedly  augmented kidney damage, macrophage infiltration, and expression of  proinflammatory macrophage cytokines compared with wild-type controls. When  subjected to the normotensive unilateral ureteral obstruction model of endogenous  RAS activation, CCL5 KO mice similarly developed more severe renal fibrosis and  greater accumulation of macrophages in the kidney, congruent with enhanced renal   expression of the macrophage chemokine CCL2. In turn, pharmacologic inhibition of  CCL2 abrogated the differences between CCL5 KO and wild-type mice in kidney  fibrosis and macrophage infiltration after unilateral ureteral obstruction. These  data indicate that CCL5 paradoxically limits macrophage accumulation in the  injured kidney during RAS activation by constraining the proinflammatory actions   of CCL2."|"ccl5,ras,kidney,macrophage,renal"|"ccl5,kidney,ras,activation,macrophage" 
"AB  - Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which describes episodic hypertension, is highly  prevalent in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). In non-SCI, primary  hypertension depresses cardiac contractile reserve via beta-adrenergic  mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether AD contributes to the  impairment in cardiac contractile function that accompanies SCI. We induced SCI  in rodents and stratified them into sham, SCI, or SCI plus repetitive induction  of AD. At 6-week post-SCI, we assessed cardiac function using in vivo  (speckle-tracking echocardiography), ex vivo (working heart), and molecular  approaches (Western blot). We also provide unique translational insight by  comparing the relationship between the number of daily AD events and cardiac  function in 14 individuals with cervical SCI. We found SCI and SCI plus  repetitive induction of AD exhibited a reduction in left ventricular dimensions  at 6-week post-SCI versus preinjury (P<0.049). Compared with sham, SCI exhibited   a reduction in peak radial strain along with a down and rightward shift in the  Starling curve (P<0.037), both of which were further depressed in SCI plus  repetitive induction of AD (P<0.042). In response to beta-adrenergic stimulation,  SCI plus repetitive induction of AD exhibited an attenuated increase in  contractile indices (P<0.001), despite no differences in beta-receptor expression  within the left ventricle. Our clinical data confirm our experimental findings by  demonstrating significant associations between the number of daily AD events and   markers of systolic and diastolic function along with left ventricular mechanics.  Here, we provide the first evidence from a translational perspective that AD  exerts insidious effects on cardiac function in rodents and humans with SCI."|"ad,sci,cardiac,function,left"|"sci,ad,cardiac,function,induction" 
"AB  - Ethanol consumption is associated with left ventricular dysfunction in heavy  ethanol drinkers. The effect of moderate ethanol intake on left ventricular  function in hypertension, however, is unknown. We investigated the relationship  between ethanol consumption and cardiac changes in nonalcoholic hypertensive  patients. In 335 patients with primary hypertension, we assessed daily ethanol  consumption by questionnaires that combined evaluation of recent and lifetime  ethanol exposure and examined cardiac structure and function by echocardiography.  Patients with abnormal liver tests, previous cardiovascular events, left  ventricular ejection fraction <50%, and creatinine clearance <30 mL/min 1.72 m(2)  were excluded. Left ventricular hypertrophy was found in 21% of hypertensive  patients and diastolic dysfunction was detected in 50% by tissue-Doppler imaging.  Ethanol consumption was comparable in hypertensive patients with and without left  ventricular hypertrophy, whereas patients with left ventricular diastolic  dysfunction had significantly greater consumption than patients with normal  ventricular filling. Left atrial diameter, e' wave velocity, e'/a' ratio, and  E/e' ratio changed progressively with increasing levels of ethanol consumption,  and prevalence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction increased with a change   that became statistically significant in patients consuming 20 g/d of ethanol or   more. The e' wave velocity was inversely correlated with ethanol consumption, and  multivariate logistic regression indicated that ethanol consumption predicted  diastolic dysfunction independently of age, body mass index, blood pressure,  insulin sensitivity, and left ventricular mass index. In conclusion, ethanol  consumption is independently associated with left ventricular diastolic  dysfunction in nonalcoholic hypertensive patients and might contribute to  development of diastolic heart failure."|"ethanol,left,ventricular,consumption,patients"|"ethanol,left,ventricular,consumption,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia, which is frequently associated with hypertension, can   be caused by alcohol intake. To date, limited data have shown the link between  alcohol intake and hyperuricemic hypertension. METHODS: We retrospectively  examined the influence of alcohol intake on the relationship between the uric  acid level and blood pressure or cardio-metabolic parameters in 171 untreated  non-failing hypertensive patients (mean 59.3+/-10.7 years). Cross-sectional  analysis was separately performed in regular alcohol drinkers (more than 25g/day   ethanol, n=74, 82.4% men) and non-drinkers (n=97, 33.0% men). RESULTS: Diastolic   blood pressure was significantly higher in drinkers than in non-drinkers  (101.6+/-11.5mmHg vs. 96.8+/-8.2mmHg, p<0.01). Estimated glomerular filtration  rate (80.4+/-14.7mL/min/1.73m(2) vs. 80.0+/-17.8mL/min/1.73m(2)) and body mass  index (BMI, 24.7+/-4.4kg/m(2) vs. 24.8+/-4.2kg/m(2)) were similar in the two  groups. In the drinker group, the uric acid level (mean 6.3+/-1.7mg/dL) was  positively correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures  (r=0.270/p=0.020 and r=0.354/p=0.0020, respectively), and with the markers of  cardiac hypertrophy, including electrocardiographic voltage (V1S+V5R,  r=0.244/p=0.042) and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index  (r=0.270/p=0.026). These correlations were also observed in the male drinker  sub-group. In the non-drinkers, the uric acid level (mean 5.0+/-1.4mg/dL) was  positively correlated with BMI (r=0.369/p=0.0002) but not with blood pressure or   the markers of cardiac hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the  role of uric acid in blood pressure might differ between hypertensive drinkers  and non-drinkers. In regular alcohol drinkers, there was a positive association  of uric acid level with blood pressure and the severity of cardiac hypertrophy.  In non-regular drinkers, an increased uric acid level is likely to be closely  associated with increased BMI."|"drinkers,alcohol,blood,non,acid"|"drinkers,acid,blood,non,uric" 
"AB  - Increased systemic vascular resistance and coronary microvascular dysfunction are  well-documented in essential hypertension (EH). We investigated the effect of  additional vasodilating treatment on coronary and peripheral resistance  circulation in EH patients with high systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI)  despite well-treated blood pressure (BP). We enroled patients on stable  antihypertensive treatment that were given intensified vasodilating therapy (ACE   inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker or calcium channel blocker). Before  and following 6 months of intensified therapy, coronary resting and maximal  artery flow were measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to calculate   coronary flow reserve (CFR) and minimum vascular resistance (C-Rmin). Cardiac  output was estimated by inert gas rebreathing to calculate SVRI. Maximal forearm   blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography to calculate  minimum vascular resistance (F-Rmin). Patients were assigned into two groups:  high-SVRI and low-SVRI subgroups, based on a median split at baseline. Following   additional treatment SVRI decreased more in the high-SVRI group than in the  low-SVRI group (14.4 vs -2.2%: P=0.003), despite similar baseline ambulatory BP  (132/81 mm Hg) and BP reduction (6.5 and 4.6%: P=0.19). F-Rmin remained unchanged  (6.5 vs -2.0%: P=0.30), while C-Rmin decreased by 22 and 24% (P=0.80) and CFR  increased by 23 and 17% (P=0.16). Thus, intensified vasodilating therapy improved  SVRI more in patients with high SVRI than in those with low SVRI. Regardless of  SVRI status, the treatment improved cardiac but not forearm dilatation capacity.   The substantial improvement of the hypertensive cardiac microvascular dysfunction  was not related to the reduction in SVRI."|"svri,coronary,resistance,treatment,patients"|"svri,resistance,coronary,high,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is related to an increased prevalence of  cardiovascular disease. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system suppression and  vascular dysfunction are considered among the main mechanisms implicated in this   association. However, interventional studies demonstrating that vitamin D  replacement reduces circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone components and  improves vascular function in humans are still lacking. METHODS: Thirty-three  consecutive patients with essential hypertension and hypovitaminosis D underwent   therapy with cholecalciferol 50 000 IU/week orally for 8 weeks. Thirty-three  hypertensive patients with normal vitamin D levels and 20 normotensive  individuals were also enrolled as control groups. At baseline and at the end of  the study, we evaluated plasma renin activity, circulating renin, angiotensin II,  aldosterone and plasma vitamin D levels. Endothelial function [flow-mediated  dilation (FMD)], carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index,  peripheral and central blood pressure were also acquired. RESULTS: After 8-week  cholecalciferol administration, all treated patients normalized plasma 25(OH)D  values. Furthermore, a reduction in plasma levels of plasma renin activity (1.17   +/- 0.3 vs 1.51 +/- 0.4 ng/ml per h, P = 0.02), renin (13.4 +/- 1.7 vs 19.2 +/-  2.9 pg/ml, P < 0.001), angiotensin II (11.6 +/- 1.6 vs 15.8 +/- 2.7 pg/ml, P =  0.02) was observed at the end of the study. FMD was significantly increased after  cholecalciferol treatment (4.4 +/- 2.6 vs 3.3 +/- 2.1%, P < 0.05), in the absence  of changes of brachial artery diameter and endothelium-independent vasodilation.   Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were not modified, as   well peripheral and central blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The restoration of normal  vitamin D levels after 8-week cholecalciferol treatment is able to inhibit  peripheral renin-angiotensin system and improve FMD in essential hypertensive  patients with hypovitaminosis D."|"renin,vitamin,angiotensin,cholecalciferol,fmd"|"renin,angiotensin,plasma,vitamin,cholecalciferol" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a common complex disorder with high heritability.   Maternal inherited pattern was observed in some families with EH, which was known  as maternally inherited essential hypertension (MIEH). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)   mutations were identified to account for some MIEH in previous studies. In the  present study, we characterized clinical manifestations and the complete  mitochondrial genome of a Chinese family with MIEH. Through analyzing the whole  mtDNA genome of the proband, we identified a mutation m.5512A > G in the MT-TW  gene that changed a highly conserved nucleotide and could potentially affect the   function of tRNA(Trp). Furthermore, significantly exercise intolerance, left  ventricular remodeling and increased arterial stiffness were observed in carriers  with mutation m.5512A > G, which further supported the potentially pathogenic  effect of m.5512A > G in MIEH."|"mieh,potentially,mitochondrial,mutation,observed"|"mieh,5512a,eh,essential,genome" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Chinese herbal medicine has been used to treat hypertension in China   and East Asia since centuries. In this study, we conduct an overview of  systematic reviews of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of primary  hypertension to 1) summarize the conclusions of these reviews, 2) evaluate the  methodological quality of these reviews, and 3) rate the confidence in the effect  on each outcome. METHODS: We comprehensively searched six databases to retrieve  systematic reviews of Chinese herbal medicine for primary hypertension from  inception to December 31, 2015. We used AMSTAR to evaluate the methodological  quality of included reviews, and we classified the quality of evidence for each  outcome in included reviews using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: A total of 12  systematic reviews with 31 outcomes were included, among which 11 systematic  reviews focus on the therapeutic effect of Chinese herbal medicine combined with   conventional medicine or simple Chinese herbal medicine versus simple  conventional medicine. Among the 11 items of AMSTAR, the lowest quality was  "providing a priori design" item, none review conformed to this item, the next  was "stating the conflict of interest" item, only three reviews conformed to this  item. Five reviews scored less than seven in AMSTAR, which means that the overall  methodological quality was fairly poor. For GRADE, of the 31 outcomes, the  quality of evidence was high in none (0 %), moderate in three (10 %), low in 19  (61 %), and very low in nine (29 %). Of the five downgrading factors, risk of  bias (100 %) was the most common downgrading factor in the included reviews,  followed by imprecision (42 %), inconsistency (39 %), publication bias (39 %),  and indirectness (0 %). CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of systematic  reviews about Chinese herbal medicine for primary hypertension is fairly poor,  and the quality of evidence level is low. Physicians should be cautious when  applying the interventions in these reviews for primary hypertension patients in   clinical practice."|"reviews,quality,hypertension,medicine,systematic"|"reviews,medicine,quality,chinese,herbal" 
"AB  - Aldose Reductase (AR), encoded by AKR1B1, is a member of NADPH-dependent  aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The C-106T polymorphism of AKR1B1 is closely  related to the diabetic complications. Our previous studies have indicated that  the expression of AR was increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting  the effect of AR in hypertension. Here we investigated whether AKR1B1 C-106T  polymorphism was associated with essential hypertension (EH). AKR1B1 C-106T  polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment  length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and the direct sequencing methods. 383 healthy  subjects and 383 essential hypertensive patients were recruited in this study.  The polymorphism of AKR1B1 C-106T in EH and normal tensive (NT) groups was in  agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. -106T allele of AKR1B1 C-106T variants  was more frequent in EH patients compared with normal tensive subjects,  indicating that -106T allele was a risk factor of EH (OR=1.841,  95%CI=1.366-2.481). In male patients, C-106T polymorphism was associated  significantly with decreased serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol and  higher systolic blood pressure levels. Our results suggest that -106T allele of  AKR1B1 C-106T polymorphism may be associated with increased risk for EH in  Chinese Han population."|"polymorphism,akr1b1,eh,ar,patients"|"106t,akr1b1,polymorphism,eh,allele" 
"AB  - Objective To investigate the relationships of blood pressure circadian rhythm and  brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in  patients with primary hypertension. Methods Totally 349 patients (74 with LVH and  275 without LVH) with primary hypertension were enrolled in this  study.Echocardiography was performed to determine left ventricular mass index  (LVMI) using the Devereux formula. The nocturnal blood pressure decline  rate,24-hour blood pressure (24 h PP; especially 24 h mean systolic blood  pressure,24 h SBP) and blood pressure index (PPI) were determined by 24  h-ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. These 349 hypertensive patients were  divided into four groups including supper-dipper group (defined as>/=;20%,  n=7),dipper group (defined as 10%- 20%, n=77),non-dipper group (defined as 0-  10%, n=173),and anti-dipper group (defined as<0, n=92). The baseline demographic   characteristics of patients were collected. Fasting blood sugar,blood  lipids,blood urea nitrogen,serum cretinine,cystatin C,uric acid,and plasma BNP  level were measured. Results The patients with LVH (n=74) had significantly  higher percentage of grade 3 hypertension (85.1% vs.  46.9%;chi(2)=34.428,P<0.001),24 h SBP (134 mmHg vs. 129 mmHg; t=3.175,P=0.002)(1   mmHg=0.133 kPa),daytime-mean SBP (134 mmHg vs. 130 mmHg;  t=2.197,P=0.029),night-mean SBP(132 mmHg vs. 121 mmHg; t=4.763,P<0.001),and 24 h   PP(57 mmHg vs. 52 mmHg; t=4.120,P<0.001) and PPI (0.43 vs. 0.41; t=3.335,P=0.001)  and lower nocturnal blood pressure decline rate [(1.30+/-8.02)% vs.  (5.68+/-7.25)%; t=-4.510,P<0.001] than the non-LVH patients (n=275). The LVH  hypertensive group had significantly higher BNP level (87.8 pg/ml vs. 28.8 pg/ml;  t=2.170,P=0.034) and LVMI (135.1 g/m(2) vs. 88.7 g/m(2); t=15.285,P<0.001) than  the control group. No significant difference was observed in the BNP level among   supper-dipper,dipper,non-dipper and anti-dipper groups (P=0.137).However,the  difference was statistically significant in the LVMI (P=0.001).  Additionally,patients in the anti-dipper group had significantly higher LVMI than  those in the dipper patients (100.3 g/m(2) vs. 86.3 g/m(2); t=4.335,P<0.001) and   non-dipper (100.3 g/m(2) vs.93.7 g/m(2); t=1.987,P=0.048). Patients in the  non-dipper group had significantly higher LVMI than those in the dipper group  (93.7 g/m(2) vs. 86.3 g/m(2); t=2.693,P=0.008). The multivariate linear  correation analysis and logistic regressions analysis suggested a significant  correlation of LVMI with BNP and the grade of hypertension. Conclusion With the  increasing of plasma BNP level,the left ventricular hypertrophy is closely  related to abnormal blood pressure circadian rhythm and the grade of hypertension  in primary hypertensive patients."|"blood,patients,pressure,bnp,lvmi"|"dipper,vs,blood,patients,group" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 50 % of hypertensive patients have lipid disorders, and  one-third of hypertensive patients have impaired glucose metabolism. Owing to the  high prevalence of metabolic risk factors and/or comorbidities, antihypertensives  with favorable or neutral metabolic effects are preferred. Based on the available  evidence, diuretics and beta-blockers are heterogeneous regarding their metabolic  effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of ACES (Antihypertensive Combinations' Long Term  Efficacy Comparing Study) was to compare the efficacy and metabolic effects of a   carvedilol/indapamide free combination, a fixed-dose combination of  perindopril/amlodipine, and a fixed combination of perindopril/indapamide in  everyday practice. METHODS: This study was a 6-month, multi-center, prospective,   observational, non-interventional, open-label clinical study. The data of 9124  outpatients (4898 female, 4226 male; mean age 61.7 +/- 11.7 years) with mild,  moderate, or severe essential (primary) hypertension with one or more metabolic  risk factors were subjected to statistical analysis. At visits one (day 1), three  (month 3), and four (month 6), the following metabolic parameters were monitored:  fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration  rate, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density  lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum potassium, sodium, creatinine,   and uric acid levels. A total of 3888 patients took perindopril/amlodipine, while  2992 took perindopril/indapamide, and 2244 took a combination of  carvedilol/indapamide. Statistical analysis was carried out using the one-paired   t test and the Chi square test; the two-sided level of significance was set at  0.05. RESULTS: The observed changes in the main metabolic parameters were  favorable and similar in all therapeutic groups: fasting blood glucose decreased   by 5.5-5.5-5.5 %, total cholesterol by 9.0-10.2-9.9 %, and triglycerides by  12.7-15.4-13.8 % (respectively in perindopril/amlodipine, perindopril/indapamide   and carvedilol/indapamide groups). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we  conclude that the metabolic profile of indapamide is very similar to the  metabolically neutral and well-documented metabolic profiles of the  calcium-channel blocker amlodipine and the vasodilator beta-blocker carvedilol  and that all the combinations studied had similar beneficial effects on the main   metabolic parameters. The favorable changes of metabolic parameters are because  of the discontinuation of active substances (e.g., conventional thiazides,  second-generation beta-blockers) used in the previous therapy, which were  associated with unfavorable metabolic effects, and to the increase in the ratio  of administered lipid-lowering drugs and oral antidiabetic drugs.

"AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the blood  pressure-lowering efficacy of fimasartan/amlodipine combination therapy was  superior to that of fimasartan monotherapy after 8 weeks of treatment in patients  with hypertension who had failed to respond adequately to fimasartan monotherapy.  METHODS: This trial was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, Phase III  clinical study. Patients who failed to respond after 4 weeks of treatment with 60  mg daily of fimasartan (sitting systolic blood pressure [SiSBP]) >/=140 mm Hg)  were randomized to receive either daily fimasartan 60 mg or fimasartan/amlodipine  60 mg/10 mg. The primary efficacy end point was the change in SiSBP from baseline  to week 8. Secondary end points included the change in SiSBP from baseline to  week 4, the changes in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline to weeks 4   and 8, and the response rate (SiSBP <140 mm Hg or decrease in SiSBP >/=20 mm Hg)   or control rate (SiSBP <140 mm Hg) at week 8. Treatment-emergent adverse events  were also assessed. FINDINGS: Of 143 patients randomized to treatment, 137  patients who had available efficacy data were analyzed. The mean age of patients   was 59.1 (8.9) years, and 100 (73.0%) were male. Baseline SiSBP and sitting  diastolic blood pressure were 150.6 (9.2) mm Hg and 91.7 (8.6) mm Hg,  respectively. In the fimasartan/amlodipine combination group, a greater reduction  in SiSBP from baseline to week 8 was observed compared with the fimasartan group   (7.8 [13.3] mm Hg in the fimasartan group vs 20.5 [14.6] mm Hg in the  fimasartan/amlodipine group; P < 0.0001). This reduction was observed after 4  weeks. The mean SiSBP changes from baseline to week 4 were 8.1 (15.8) mm Hg in  the fimasartan group and 20.1 (14.7) mm Hg in the fimasartan/amlodipine group (P   < 0.0001). At week 8, the response rate was significantly higher in the  fimasartan/amlodipine (82.1%) group than in the fimasartan (32.9%) group (P <  0.0001). The control rate at week 8 was also higher in the fimasartan/amlodipine   (79.1%) group than in the fimasartan (31.4%) group (P < 0.0001). Adverse drug  reactions were observed in 9 patients (6.3%), with no significant differences  between treatment groups. There were no serious adverse events associated with  the study drugs. IMPLICATIONS: Fimasartan/amlodipine combination therapy  exhibited superior efficacy in reducing blood pressure, with no increase in  adverse drug reactions, compared with fimasartan monotherapy.

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of  lercanidipine/enalapril fixed-dose combination in patients with mild to moderate   essential hypertension. METHODS: Four observational studies on patients with  sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) between 95 and 109 mmHg, treated with  lercanidipine/enalapril fixed-dose combination, were analyzed. The Random-Effect   Model was used to limit heterogeneity across the studies. Weights were applied to  determine the influence of each study on the combined results. The efficacy  outcome measure was the reduction from baseline to endpoint in systolic and  diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively). The incidence of  treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was also investigated. RESULTS: The  total number of patients analyzed for efficacy and safety was 9565. No  differences between study groups in demographics characteristics were observed.  Mean blood pressure in the pooled population of the four studies was 162/94 mmHg   at baseline. Overall, the lercanidipine/enalapril fixed-dose combination reduced   SBP by 26 mmHg (95% CI, 23-29), and DBP by 13 mmHg (12-15), p < 0.05 for both. No  safety concerns were reported. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis supports the use of  the lercanidipine/enalapril fixed-dose combination for the treatment of  mild-to-moderate hypertension."|"patients,efficacy,studies,blood,pressure"|"combination,dose,enalapril,fixed,lercanidipine" 
"AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the degree of morning blood pressure  surge (MBPS) and its relationship with markers of cardiovascular alterations in  untreated middle-aged hypertensives. We studied 241 patients (mean age, 36.6 +/-   10.7 years). Subjects with higher sleep-through MBPS (st-MBPS) were older (P =  .003), had higher carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) (P = .05) and lower E/A  ratio (P = .01) than those with lower MBPS. Subjects with higher prewakening MBPS  (pw-MBPS) had significantly higher deceleration time (P = .01) compared with  those with lower pw-MBPS. St-MBPS correlated significantly with age, cIMT values,  24-hour systolic and diastolic BP, and systolic BP night-time fall. The  significant correlations between pw-MBPS and cIMT values, deceleration time,  24-hour diastolic BP and systolic BP night-time fall were observed. A  relationship between MBPS and cardiovascular alterations was observed both in  dippers and nondippers, although in non-dippers, it was less pronounced. The  results may imply a possible link between MBPS and markers of cardiovascular  alterations in untreated hypertensive subjects."|"mbps,time,cimt,higher,alterations"|"mbps,bp,higher,time,alterations" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the setting of normal sodium (Na) intake, many patients with  hypertension have inappropriately elevated plasma aldosterone (Aldo) levels and  may be at increased risk for tissue damage. Moreover, other adrenocortical  steroids, including endogenous ouabain can stimulate tissue damage. As endogenous  ouabain is often elevated in chronically Na-loaded states, is a vasoconstrictor,   raises blood pressure (BP), and also promotes tissue fibrosis, we investigated  the extent to which plasma Aldo and endogenous ouabain were coelevated among  naive hypertensive patients (NHP). We also investigated the impact of an acute  salt load on these steroids, BP, and renal function. METHODS: NHP (590) were  grouped in tertiles based on their baseline plasma Aldo (mean +/- SEM first 7.59   +/- 0.18, versus third 24.15 +/- 0.31 ng/dl). Baseline plasma renin activity (2.4  +/- 0.1 versus 1.2 +/- 0.1 ng/ml per h, P < 0.001), endogenous ouabain (268 +/-  14.9 pmol/l versus 239.0 +/- 13.6 pmol, P < 0.01) and DBP (91.9 +/- 0.76 versus  89.6 +/- 0.71 mmHg, P = 0.017) were higher in NHP in the third versus the first  Aldo tertile, respectively. RESULTS: Acute Na loading showed that the BP of the  third Aldo tertile NHP was especially salt-sensitive (slope of  pressure-natriuresis relationship 0.015 +/- 0.002 versus 0.003 +/- 0.001  muEq/mmHg per min, P = 0.00024 after adjustment for sex, BMI, and age).  Regression analyses showed that plasma Aldo and endogenous ouabain were linearly   related (beta = 0.181, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Among patients with essential  hypertension, circulating endogenous ouabain and Aldo are typically coelevated  and their BP is salt-sensitive. In conditions where Aldo is inappropriately  elevated, both Aldo and endogenous ouabain may contribute to adverse  cardiovascular and renal outcomes."|"aldo,endogenous,ouabain,plasma,bp"|"aldo,endogenous,ouabain,versus,plasma" 
"AB  - Nowadays, fixed drug combinations are very important part of pharmacotherapy in  essential arterial hypertension. The ameliorated activity of RAAS system (ACE  inhibitors or sartans) along with calcium-ion channel inhibitor results in  additive decrease of blood pressure with concomitant beneficial safety profile.  Both telmisartan and amlodipine possess very favorable pharmacological  properties, what is reflected in results of performed clinical trials, in which  they were used as combinations."|"results,combinations,important,part,ace"|"combinations,results,ace,activity,additive" 
"AB  - Objective: To compare the incidence of metabolic disorders and uric acid (UA)  levels between patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) and essential  hypertension (EH), and to explore factors associated with UA levels in these  patients. Methods: A total of 117 PA and 117 EH patients individually matched by   sex, age, blood pressure and duration of hypertension were recruited from  in-hospital patients who were hospitalized in our department because of suspicion  of secondary hypertension from January 2008 to December 2014. Clinical data  including metabolic disorders and UA levels were analyzed. Results: (1) Body mass  index (BMI), waist circumference, plasma triglyceride (TG), low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), free fatty acid (FFA) were significantly higher   in EH than in PA group (all P<0.05). Prevalence of diabetes mellitus or impaired   glucose tolerance (DM+ IGT) was significantly higher in EH than in PA group  (41.9% (49/117) vs. 17.1% (20/117), P<0.01). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome  (MS) was also significantly higher in EH than in PA group (51.3% (60/117) vs.  24.8% (29/117), P<0.01). (2) EH patients had higher homeostasis model assessment   for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lower insulin sensitivity index composite  (ISI comp) than PA patients, but basic insulin secretion index (HOMA-beta) and  modified beta cell function index (MBCI) were significantly lower in PA than in  EH group (P<0.05). (3) With regard to target organs damages, PA patients revealed  higher 24-hour urinary protein, urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER), urinary  IgG, urinary alpha-1 microglobulin, left ventricular mass index and lower urine  specific gravity than EH patients (all P<0.05). There was no significant  difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between two groups  (P=0.103). (4) UA level was significantly lower in PA group than in EH group  ((314.00+/-89.52) mumol/L vs. (379.16+/-101.25) mumol/L, P<0.01). Higher plasma  aldosterone concentration and lower plasma renin activity were associated with  lower UA level in PA group. Conclusions: Compared with sex, age and hypertension   duration matched EH patients, PA patients revealed lower UA level and less severe  abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism, but are associated with severer  renal and cardiac damages. The reduced UA level in PA patients is possibly due to  the high plasma aldosterone concentration and low plasma renin activity."|"patients,pa,eh,ua,index"|"pa,patients,eh,group,lower" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the level of serum cystatin C   (s-CC) and reverse-dipper blood pressure (BP) pattern. DESIGN: Cross-sectional  study. SETTING: Single centre. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 718 hypertensive patients  were eventually recruited from cardiac clinics between 2012 and 2014 in the  Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. They were diagnosed as  essential hypertension according to their casual office records of systolic blood  pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Patients were excluded if  they were <18 or >90 years old, under antihypertensive treatment, night workers,   suffering from acute stroke or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,  diagnosed as secondary hypertension, sleep apnoea or other sleep disorders, renal  failure, cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, women during  pregnancy or intolerant to the ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). MEASUREMENT: The   selected patients were evaluated with 24 hours ABPM. Peripheral venous blood  samples were collected to evaluate the s-CC levels by ELISA. METHODS: The  distribution of hypertensive patients with different levels of s-CC among each  circadian BP pattern group was analysed using analysis of variance. Multinomial  logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between the   relevant variables and ABPM results. RESULTS: S-CC level in reverse-dipper group   (1.19+/-0.53 mg/L) was increased significantly when compared with dipper group  (1.06+/-0.36 mg/L) (p=0.021). In addition, after multinomial logistic regression   analysis, s-CC (OR 1.717; 95% CI 1.033 to 2.854; p=0.037) and diabetes (OR 2.313;  95% CI 1.401 to 3.821; p=0.01) were significantly different between the  reverse-dipper group and dipper group. On the other hand, the decline rate of  nocturnal SBP (r=-0.117; p=0.002) and DBP (r=-0.089; p=0.018) was negatively  correlated with the s-CC level. CONCLUSIONS: The s-CC level was significantly  higher in the reverse-dipper group than the dipper group and that s-CC was  associated with the reverse-dipper pattern of BP examined with 24 hour ABPM."|"cc,patients,bp,blood,group"|"cc,dipper,group,reverse,abpm" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study a non-drug therapy for hypertension disease by combining  percutaneous laser and electric pulse stimulation to acupoint with music, and to   test the efficiency of the combining treatment to grade 1 essential hypertension.  METHODS: A total of 174 patients with grade 1 essential hypertension were  randomly assigned to 3 groups with a random number table after Chinese medicine  (CM) syndrome differentiation: the photoelectric and musical treatment group  (Group 1, with a self-developed multi-mode audio frequency pulse photoelectric  therapeutic apparatus), acupuncture group (Group 2), and oral placebo group  (Group 3), 58 cases per group. The curative effect of each group was evaluated by  the changes of blood pressure and CM syndrome integral before and after  treatment. RESULTS: Compared with Group 3, there were significant decrease of  blood pressure and CM syndrome integral in Group 1 and Group 2 (P<0.01). Compared  with Group 2, Group 1 showed the highest decrease in systolic pressure (P<0.017).  The total effective rate of anti-hypertension in Group 1 (91.38%, 53/58) was  significantly higher than that in Group 2 (74.13%, 43/58) and Group 3 (18.97%,  11/58, P<0.05 or P<0.01); and that in Group 2 was also significantly higher than   that in Group 3 (P<0.01). There were significant difference in the total  effective rate of CM syndrome integral in both Group 1 (93.10%, 54/58) and Group   2 (84.48%, 49/58) as compared with Group 3 (17.24%, 10/58, P<0.01), while there  was no significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS:   The multi-mode audio frequency pulse photoelectric therapeutic apparatus,  combining music, laser and electric pulse stimulation, is clinically useful for  grade 1 essential hypertension. This "three in one" therapy method is  non-invasive, easy and simple to handle. It is expected to be popularized as a  new alternative treatment."|"group,hypertension,treatment,cm,pulse"|"group,58,hypertension,01,cm" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify novel biomarkers associated with pediatric primary  hypertension. METHODS: We recruited 350 participants (4-16 years). Anthropometric  parameters and aldosterone, plasma renin activity, cortisol, cortisone,  Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein, adiponectin, IL-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1  levels and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-9 and  MMP-2) activities were measured. Genomic DNA was isolated. Patients with altered   glucose metabolism, severe obesity [BMI-SD score (BMI-SDS) > 2.5], renovascular  disease, primary aldosteronism and apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome  were excluded. RESULTS: In selected participants (n = 320), SBP was positively  correlated with BMI-SDS (r = 0.382, P < 0.001), HOMA-IR (r = 0.211, P < 0.001),  MMP-9 activity (r = 0.215, P < 0.001) and the cortisol/cortisone ratio (r =  0.231, P < 0.001). DBP showed similar correlations with these variables. No  correlation was observed with aldosterone or plasma renin activity. Participants   were categorized as hypertensive (n = 59) or nonhypertensive (n = 261). In the  univariate analysis, hypertensive patients had higher BMI-SDS (P < 0.001),  HOMA-IR (P < 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P < 0.001), MMP-9  activity (P < 0.001), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (P < 0.001) and  cortisol/cortisone ratio (P < 0.001) than nonhypertensive patients. Multiple  regression analysis showed that the variables that remained associated with  hypertension were higher BMI-SDS [odds ratio (OR) = 3.74; 95% confidence interval  (CI) = 1.84-7.58], a higher cortisol/cortisone ratio (OR = 3.92; 95% CI =  1.98-7.71) and increased MMP-9 activity (OR = 4.23; 95% CI = 2.15-8.32).  CONCLUSION: We report that MMP-9 activity and the cortisol/cortisone ratio were  higher in pediatric primary hypertensive patients, and these associations were  independent of the effect of obesity. The potential role of these novel  biomarkers in predicting hypertension risk and blood pressure regulation warrants  further investigation."|"patients,bmi,activity,mmp,primary"|"001,activity,mmp,bmi,cortisol" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of  metalloproteinases (TIMP) are involved in cardiovascular remodeling in  hypertension. Because metabolic abnormalities typical of metabolic syndrome is  the dominant phenotype of primary hypertension in children, we hypothesized that   MMP-9 and TIMP-1 plasma concentrations are altered in hypertensive children and  correlate with metabolic abnormalities and target organ damage. METHOD: A total  of 109 children (15.6, 10-17 years) with untreated primary hypertension were  included to the study. The control group consisted of 74 healthy, normotensive  children. RESULTS: Plasma MMP-9, TIMP-1 concentrations, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio  were significantly elevated in hypertensive boys in comparison with normotensive   boys (P = 0.0001, P = 0.04, and P = 0.001, respectively), whereas there were no  differences between hypertensive and normotensive girls. The levels of MMP-9 and   TIMP-1 as well as MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio were not associated either with hypertension  stage, left ventricular hypertrophy, or carotid intima-media thickness. However,   in a subgroup of 30 hypertensive patients in whom arterial stiffness was  measured, TIMP-1 concentrations correlated with aortic pulse pressure (P < 0.05;   r = 0.367), augmentation pressure (P < 0.05; r = 0.428), and augmentation index  (P < 0.05; r = 0.404).Only hypertensive boys presented negative correlations of  both MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r =  -0.254, P = 0.01 and r = -0.241, P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION:  Hypertensive boys but not girls had elevated MMP-9 and TIMP-1 plasma  concentrations, which indicates sex-related role of MMP/TIMP system in pediatric   hypertension. The correlation between serum TIMP-1 and markers of arterial  stiffness indicates on the involvement of TIMPs in arterial remodeling."|"timp,mmp,hypertension,hypertensive,concentrations"|"timp,mmp,hypertensive,hypertension,boys" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: In a free drug combination, each Blood pressure (BP)-lowering drug is  administered as a separate pill, while in a fixed drug combination several  BP-lowering agents are combined in a single pill. Using a single pill may enhance  compliance and simplify treatment, which would translate into better clinical  outcomes. The objective of this meta-analysis is to compare the effects of using   a fixed combination versus free combination of BP-lowering agents in the  management of patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: We searched Cochrane  CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing the  objective of the review and assessing at least one of the following outcomes:  BP-lowering efficacy, rapidity in achieving BP target, compliance, incidence of  side effects, mortality, and morbidity. Two review authors independently selected  eligible studies, abstracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included trials.   The primary meta-analyses used a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified  seven RCTs with a total of 397 participants. Meta-analysis of efficacy in  controlling BP showed a non-significant reduction of mean systolic BP of 0.81  mmHg (95% CI -3.25, 1.64) favoring the fixed combination group. As for adverse  events, results showed a non-significant 13% risk reduction favoring the free  combination (risk ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.85, 1.5). Low quality of evidence was  noted for both outcomes. Rapidity in achieving BP target was assessed in only one  trial, and the results favored the fixed combination. Adherence to treatment was   assessed in three trials, no pooled analysis was possible for this outcome. None   of the included trials assessed mortality and morbidity. CONCLUSION: The  available low quality evidence does not confirm or rule out a substantive  difference between fixed combination and free combination therapy in the  management of HTN. Well designed RCTs with a long duration of follow-up and  assessment of morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed."|"bp,combination,fixed,assessed,trials"|"combination,bp,fixed,assessed,free" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a complex chronic condition characterized by elevated  arterial blood pressure. Management of hypertension includes non-pharmacologic  strategies, which may include techniques that effectively reduce autonomic  sympathetic activity. Respiratory exercises improve autonomic control over  cardiovascular system and attenuate muscle metaboreflex. Because of these  effects, respiratory exercises may be useful to lower blood pressure in subjects   with hypertension. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial  will test the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training in reducing blood pressure   in adults with essential hypertension. Subjects are randomly allocated to  intervention or control groups. Intervention consists of inspiratory muscle  training loaded with 40 % of maximum inspiratory pressure, readjusted weekly.  Control sham intervention consists of unloaded exercises. Systolic and diastolic   blood pressures are co-primary endpoint measures assessed with 24 h ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring. Secondary outcome measures include cardiovascular  autonomic control, inspiratory muscle metaboreflex, cardiopulmonary capacity, and  inspiratory muscle strength and endurance. DISCUSSION: Previously published work   suggests that inspiratory muscle training reduces blood pressure in persons with   hypertension, but the effectiveness of this intervention is yet to be  established. We propose an adequately sized randomized clinical trial to test  this hypothesis rigorously. If an effect is found, this study will allow for the   investigation of putative mechanisms to mediate this effect, including autonomic   cardiovascular control and metaboreflex.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have found that mild secondary hyperparathyroidism  might be another clinical feature of patients with primary aldosteronims (PA),  but whether serum parathyroid hormone level (PTH) is correlated with subtypes of   PA and what contributes to the elevated PTH level remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To   illustrate the changes of PTH in PA and to partly explain the mechanism of how  the effects of aldosterone regulating the secretion of PTH in PA. METHODS: We  enrolled a total of 120 patients with primary hypertension (PH) and 242 patients   with PA, which included 89 APAs (aldosterone-producing adenoma), 119 IHAs  (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) and 34 UAHs (unilateral adrenal hyperplasia). The  plasma levels of aldosterone, renin activity, parathyroid hormone and markers  associated with calcium metabolism were measured. RESULTS: We found serum PTH  level was significantly elevated in patients with PA compared with primary  hypertension [9.0 (6.6, 11.7) vs 5.7 (4.4, 7.0)] pmol/l, P < 0.001]. However, no   difference was found between the three PA subtypes (P > 0.05). Stepwise multiple   regression analysis showed that in patients with PA, serum levels of K(+) and  Ca(2+) were independently associated with serum PTH level. More importantly,  elevated PTH level could be corrected either by unilateral adrenalectomy [9.9  (7.5, 12.8) vs 5.2 (4.4, 7.0) pmol/l, P < 0.001] or mineralocorticoid receptor  (MR) antagonists treatment [11.7 (9.1, 13.4) vs 6.3 (5.1, 7.8) pmol/l, P <  0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: PTH level is elevated in PA patients and irrelevant with  subtypes of PA. Serum K(+) and serum Ca(2+) level are main factors influence the   plasma PTH level in PA patients. After medical or surgical treatment, PTH levels   return to normal."|"pa,pth,patients,level,serum"|"pa,pth,level,patients,serum" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate if polymorphisms of APLN and APLNR genes  may play a role as susceptibility markers for hypertension in a group of  Mexican-Mestizo patients. A case-control study was carried out including  normotensive and hypertensive individuals. For these, two polymorphisms of APLN  (rs3761581 and rs56204867) and two of APLNR () genes were genotyped by 5'  exonuclease TaqMan assay in 400 normotensive individuals and 383 patients. The  results showed that, under an additive model adjusted by BMI, HDL, triglycerides,  glucose and family history of essential hypertension, the rs7119375 and  rs10501367 polymorphisms of APLNR gene were associated significantly with a  decreased risk of essential hypertension (P=0.039 and P=0.029, respectively).  Besides, the haplotypes analysis of these polymorphisms showed that H1 haplotype   was associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension (P=0.026), while   the H2 haplotype was associated with a decreased risk (P=0.032). Contrary, the  rs3761581 and rs56204867 polymorphisms of APLN gene were not associated with  essential hypertension (P=0.1707 and P=0.0769, respectively). The data suggest  that APLNR rs7119375 and rs10501367 are associated with a decreased risk of  essential hypertension in our Mexican-Mestizo studied group, but further studies   are warranted."|"hypertension,polymorphisms,aplnr,essential,associated"|"hypertension,associated,essential,polymorphisms,aplnr" 
"AB  - Mitochondrial injury contributes to renal dysfunction in several models of renal   disease, but its involvement in human hypertension remains unknown. Fragments of   the mitochondrial genome released from dying cells are considered surrogate  markers of mitochondrial injury. We hypothesized that hypertension would be  associated with increased urine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers. We  prospectively measured systemic and urinary copy number of the mtDNA genes  cytochrome-c oxidase-3 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit-1 by quantitative  polymerase chain reaction in essential (n=25) and renovascular (RVH, n=34)  hypertensive patients and compared them with healthy volunteers (n=22). Urinary  kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin served as  indices of renal injury. Renal blood flow and oxygenation were assessed by  multidetector computed tomography and blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic  resonance imaging. Blood pressure, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated  lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule-1 were similarly elevated in essential  hypertension and RVH, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was lower in RVH  versus healthy volunteers and essential hypertension. Renal blood flow was lower   in RVH compared with essential hypertension. Urinary mtDNA copy number was higher  in hypertension compared with healthy volunteers, directly correlated with  urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1  and inversely with estimated glomerular filtration rate. In RVH, urinary mtDNA  copy number correlated directly with intrarenal hypoxia. Furthermore, in an  additional validation cohort, urinary mtDNA copy number was higher in RVH  compared with healthy volunteers (n=10 each). The change in serum creatinine  levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate 3 months after medical therapy  without or with revascularization correlated with the change in urinary mtDNA.  Therefore, elevated urinary mtDNA copy numbers in hypertensive patients  correlated with markers of renal injury and dysfunction, implicating  mitochondrial injury in kidney damage in human hypertension."|"urinary,hypertension,injury,mtdna,mitochondrial"|"urinary,injury,hypertension,mtdna,copy" 
"AB  - Triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio  (TG/HDL-C) has been suggested as a simple method to identify unfavorable  cardiovascular outcomes in the general population. The effect of the TG/HDL-C  ratio on essential hypertensive patients is unclear. About 900 consecutive  essential hypertensive patients (mean age 52.9+/-12.6 years, 54.2% male) who  visited our outpatient hypertension clinic were analyzed. Participants were  divided into quartiles based on baseline TG/HDL-C ratio and medical records were   obtained periodically for the occurrence of fatal events and composite major  adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) including transient ischemic attack,  stroke, aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome, and death. Participants were   followed for a median of 40 months (interquartile range, 35-44 months). Overall,   a higher quartile of TG/HDL-C ratio at baseline was significantly linked with  higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Using multivariate   Cox regression analysis, plasma TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with   increased risk of fatal events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval   [CI], 1.13-1.37; P</=.001] and MACEs (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.21; P</=.001).  Increased plasma TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with more fatal events and MACEs  in essential hypertensive patients."|"hdl,tg,ratio,events,fatal"|"hdl,ratio,tg,events,fatal" 
"AB  - This systematic review investigates the high level of hypertension found among  urban dwellers in West Africa and in the West African Diaspora in the Americas in  relation to variants within the genes encoding the renin angiotensinogen system.   For comparison, the results from the Caucasian populations are reviewed as well.   Through a PubMed search, 1252 articles were identified and 28 eligible articles  assessed in detail of which 13 included a Caucasian population. The results  suggest that among the people of West African descent and among the people of  Caucasian descent, hypertension is partly related to a number of single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the renin gene, the  angiotensinogen gene, the angiotensinogen I-converting enzyme gene and the  angiotensinogen II type 1 receptor gene. Concordance between these two  populations was found for some SNPs. However, for others, it was found that the  SNPs associating with hypertension and the disease allele frequencies differed  between these populations. Understanding the importance of these variants in a  modern life setting may assist our understanding of the increased risk of  developing hypertension among West Africans. Because of inconsistency in the  results, low statistical power and methodological differences between studies,  these results can only be taken as indicative of an association."|"hypertension,results,among,populations,caucasian"|"angiotensinogen,gene,hypertension,results,west" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal denervation (RDN), treating resistant hypertension, has, in  open trial design, been shown to lower blood pressure (BP) dramatically, but this  was primarily with respect to office BP. METHOD: We conducted a SHAM-controlled,   double-blind, randomized, single-center trial to establish efficacy data based on  24-h ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM). Inclusion criteria were daytime systolic   ABPM at least 145 mmHg following 1 month of stable medication and 2 weeks of  compliance registration. All RDN procedures were carried out by an experienced  operator using the unipolar Medtronic Flex catheter (Medtronic, Santa Rosa,  California, USA). RESULTS: We randomized 69 patients with treatment-resistant  hypertension to RDN (n = 36) or SHAM (n = 33). Groups were well balanced at  baseline. Mean baseline daytime systolic ABPM was 159 +/- 12 mmHg (RDN) and 159  +/- 14 mmHg (SHAM). Groups had similar reductions in daytime systolic ABPM  compared with baseline at 3 months [-6.2 +/- 18.8 mmHg (RDN) vs. -6.0 +/- 13.5  mmHg (SHAM)] and at 6 months [-6.1 +/- 18.9 mmHg (RDN) vs. -4.3 +/- 15.1 mmHg  (SHAM)]. Mean usage of antihypertensive medication (daily defined doses) at 3  months was equal [6.8 +/- 2.7 (RDN) vs. 7.0 +/- 2.5 (SHAM)].RDN performed at a  single center and by a high-volume operator reduced ABPM to the same level as  SHAM treatment and thus confirms the result of the HTN3 trial. CONCLUSION:  Further, clinical use of RDN for treatment of resistant hypertension should await  positive results from double-blinded, SHAM-controlled trials with multipolar  ablation catheters or novel denervation techniques."|"sham,rdn,abpm,trial,bp"|"rdn,sham,mmhg,abpm,baseline" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II (Ang II) is thought to play an important role in the  development of hypertension. Nevertheless, knowledge on the angiotensin II  type-1-receptors (AT1Rs) in the hypertensive kidney and the influence of sodium  intake and renin-angiotensin system activity on intrarenal AT1R blockade is  scarce. To improve our understanding of renal AT1Rs in hypertensive patients, we   studied the effects of acute, local administration of AT1R-blocker eprosartan in   kidneys of patients with essential hypertension (off medication). METHOD: In 73  hypertensive patients who were scheduled for diagnostic renal angiography, we  measured renal blood flow (Xenon washout method) before and during intrarenal  infusion of two incremental doses of eprosartan (3 and 10 mug/kg/min for 15 min  per dose). We hypothesized that the vasodilatory effects of eprosartan would be  enhanced by low sodium intake and would be reduced during Ang II co-infusion.  Therefore, we allocated the patients to either a high or a low sodium diet and  coinfused Ang II (1 ng/kg/min) in a subgroup. RESULTS: Eprosartan infusion  resulted in intrarenal vasodilation in all groups. No differences in the  magnitude of this effect were found between the groups. No correlation was found   between 24-h urinary sodium excretion (a proxy for dietary sodium intake) and the  effect of eprosartan. CONCLUSION: Eprosartan-induced vasodilation is not  influenced by sodium intake and/or co-infusion of Ang II. These rather unexpected  findings could be explained by differences between circulating and tissue Ang II   levels, variations in AT1R expression, and/or stimulation of other vasodilatory  pathways."|"ii,eprosartan,sodium,ang,patients"|"ii,eprosartan,sodium,ang,infusion" 
"AB  - Although the endothelium has a number of important functions, the term  endothelial dysfunction is commonly used to describe impairment in its  vasodilatory capacity. It is increasingly recognized that this is related to  hypertension, although whether it predates essential hypertension or is a  consequence of it is still unknown. In this review, we explore the mechanisms of   endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension, its prognostic significance  and methods of pharmacological reversal."|"hypertension,dysfunction,essential,endothelial,although"|"hypertension,dysfunction,endothelial,essential,capacity" 
"AB  - The very common GNB3 c.825C>T polymorphism (rs5443) is present in approximately  half of all human chromosomes. Significantly, the presence of the GNB3 825T  allele has been strongly associated with predisposition to essential  hypertension. Paradoxically the presence of the GNB3 825T allele, in exon 10,  introduces a pathogenic alternative RNA splice site into the middle of exon 9. To  attempt to correct this pathogenic aberrant splicing, we, therefore,  bioinformatically designed, using a Gene Tools((R)) algorithm, a GNB3-specific,  antisense morpholino. It was hoped that this morpholino would behave in vitro as   either a potential splice blocker and/or exon skipper, to both bind and  inhibit/reduce the aberrant splicing of the GNB3 825T allele. On transfecting a  human lymphoblast cell line homozygous for the 825T allele, with this antisense  morpholino, we encouragingly observed both a significant reduction (from  approximately 58% to approximately 5%) in the production of the aberrant smaller   GNB3 transcript, and a subsequent increase in the normal GNB3 transcript (from  approximately 42% to approximately 95%). Our results demonstrate the potential  use of a GNB3-specific antisense morpholino, as a pharmacogenetic therapy for  essential hypertension."|"gnb3,allele,approximately,morpholino,exon"|"gnb3,approximately,825t,allele,morpholino" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of  calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase 4 (CAMK4) and the therapeutic effect of  amlodipine in essential hypertensive patients in Chinese Han nationality.  METHODS: A total of 108 mild-to-moderate essential hypertension patients in  Chinese Han nationality were treated with amlodipine for 8 weeks at a dosage of 5  mg/d. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was  performed to detect the genotypes (rs10491334). Blood pressure was measured and  analyzed. RESULTS: The result of rs10491334 polymorphism of CAMK4 was consistent   with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium distribution and the frequencies of C allele and   T allele were 88.89% and 11.11%, respectively. The systolic blood pressure and  diastolic blood pressure before amlodipine treatment were not statistically  different among different genotype carriers (P>0.05). The blood pressure was  significantly reduced in all patients after amlodipine treatment (P<0.05).  Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in patients with rs10491334  CC genotype and CT genotype compared with those patients with rs10491334 TT  genotype. Total effective rates of CT and TT carriers were higher than those of  the CC genotype carriers (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The CAMK4 gene polymorphism might   be associated with the efficacy of calcium channel blocker in treating  mild-to-moderate essential hypertension patients."|"amlodipine,patients,camk4,rs10491334,polymorphism"|"patients,blood,genotype,pressure,amlodipine"

RESULTS: After adjusted for  age, gender, body mass index and other related factors, logistic regression  analysis showed that 3 loci (rs11689546, rs7593130, rs2241759)were associated  with EH. AG genotype of rs11689546 was associated with 0.494 times lower risk of   EH (OR=0.494, 95%CI 0.246-0.993; compared with AA genotype). CT genotype of  rs7593130 was associated with 1.596 times higher risk of EH (OR=1.596, 95%CI  1.009-2.524; compared with TT genotype), and CT/CC genotype of rs7593130 was  associated with 1.627 times higher risk of EH (OR=1.627, 95%CI 1.034-2.559;  compared with TT genotype). AG genotype of rs2241759 was associated with 0.669  times lower risk of EH (OR=0.669, 95%CI 0.503-0.891; compared with AA genotype),   and CT/CC genotype of rs2241759 was associated with 0.687 times lower risk of EH   (OR=0.687, 95%CI 0.518-0.911; compared with TT genotype). CONCLUSION: The  polymorphisms of ADCY3 are associated with lower (G allele of the rs11689546  locus and G allele of the rs2241759 locus) or higher (C allele of the rs7593130  locus) risk of essential hypertension."|"eh,tag,rs7593130,associated,adcy3"|"genotype,eh,associated,risk,95" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Two renalase single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2296545  and rs2576178 have been reported to be associated with the susceptibility to  hypertension (HT). Given the inconsistent results, we conducted a meta-analysis  to assess the association between these two SNPs and the risk of HT. METHODS:  Electronic databases were systematically searched to find relevant studies.  Subgroup analysis was conducted according to the different concomitant diseases  and ethnicities in the study population. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95%  confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect  models. RESULTS: A total of six case-control studies on rs2296545 and six studies  on rs2576178 were included. In the combined analysis, results showed a  significant association between SNP rs2296545 and risk of HT in all genetic  models (dominant model CG+CC/GG: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.24-1.65; recessive model  CC/CG+GG: OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.09-1.69; codominant model CC/GG: OR = 1.63, 95%  CI = 1.20-2.20, CG/GG: OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.12-1.52; allelic model C/G: OR =  1.29, 95% CI = 1.10-1.51). In subgroup analysis, we observed a significant  association between rs2296545 and risk of essential HT. Although we did not  observe an association between rs2576178 polymorphism and HT in the combined  analysis, an increased risk was observed in the essential HT patients versus  healthy controls (subgroup 1) analysis under the dominant, recessive, and  codominant genetic models. CONCLUSIONS: Renalase gene rs2296545 polymorphism is  significantly associated with increased risk of HT, whereas rs2576178  polymorphism may not be associated with the susceptibility to HT."|"ht,analysis,rs2296545,risk,results"|"ht,95,analysis,ci,risk" 
"AB  - Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) acts as a decoy to  prevent interaction between RAGE and its pro-inflammatory ligands. sRAGE levels  have been found to decrease in chronic inflammatory diseases, including  hypertension. However, few data have been reported concerning the association  between serum sRAGE levels and hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).  Fasting blood samples were obtained from 209 essential hypertensive patients, and  sRAGE levels were measured using a commercially available double-sandwich  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. All patients underwent complete  transthoracic echocardiographic examination. LVH was defined as a left  ventricular mass index >115 g/m(2) for men and >95 g/m(2) for women. Eighty-one  hypertensive patients (38.76%) were categorized in the LVH(+) group. Age (P =  0.009), hypertension duration (P = 0.013), triglyceride levels (P = 0.028), and  systolic blood pressure (P = 0.026) were higher, and sRAGE and high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in the LVH(+) group compared with the  LVH(-) group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sRAGE level  [odds ratio (OR) = 0.916; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.864-0.984; P = 0.003],  hypertension duration (OR = 1.024; 95%CI = 1.003-1.052; P = 0.027), and  triglyceride level (OR = 1.017; 95%CI = 1.005-1.039; P = 0.018) were independent   predictors of LVH in hypertensive patients. In conclusion, serum sRAGE level was   inversely associated with LVH in hypertensive patients."|"srage,levels,lvh,patients,hypertensive"|"lvh,srage,hypertensive,levels,patients" 
"AB  - The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), remodeling of the  vasculature, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) play important roles in the  development of essential hypertension (EH), which is defined as high blood  pressure (BP) in which secondary causes, such as renovascular disease, are  absent. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is involved in the regulation of BP.   However, the underlying mechanisms by which the CaSR regulates BP are poorly  understood. In the present study, the role of the CaSR in EH was investigated  using male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and rat and human plasma  samples. The percentages of medial wall thickness to external diameter (WT%),  total vessel wall cross-sectional area to the total area (WA%) of thoracic  arteries, as well as the percentage of wall area occupied by collagen to total  vessel wall area (CA%) were determined. Tissue protein expression and plasma  concentrations of the CaSR, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), renin, and  angiotensin II (Ang II) were additionally assessed. WT%, WA%, and CA% were found   to increase with increasing BP, whereas the plasma concentration of CaSR was  found to decrease. With increasing BP, the levels of smooth muscle actin and  calponin decreased, whereas those of osteopontin and proliferating cell nuclear  antigen increased. The CaSR level negatively correlated with the levels of cAMP  and Ang II, but positively correlated with those of renin. Our data suggest that   reduced expression of the CaSR is correlated with activation of the RAS, which  induces increased vascular remodeling and VSMC proliferation, and thereby  associated with EH in the SHR model and in the Han Chinese population. Our  findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of EH."|"casr,bp,eh,plasma,wall"|"casr,bp,area,eh,wall" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant hypertension is a condition characterized by severe  hypertension and multi-organ ischemic complications. Albeit mortality and renal  survival have improved with antihypertensive therapy, progression to end-stage  renal disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The  underlying cause of malignant hypertension, which can be primary or secondary  hypertension, is often difficult to identify and this can substantially affect  the treatment outcomes, as we report here. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old woman  presented with severe hypertension and acute renal failure. Initial evaluation  demonstrated hyperreninemia with hyperaldosteronism and a possible renal artery  stenosis at the contrast-enhanced CT scan. Although this data suggested the  presence of a secondary form of hypertension, further exams excluded our first  diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Consequently, the patient did not undergo  renal angiography (and the contrast media infusion associated with it), but she  continued to be medically treated to achieve a tight blood pressure control. Our   conservative approach was successful to induce renal function recovery over 2  years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the difficulty in  differentiating between primary and secondary forms of malignant hypertension,  particularly when the patient presents with acute renal failure. Clinicians  should consider renal artery ultrasound as a first level diagnostic technique,  given that the presentation of primary malignant hypertension can often mimic a  renal artery stenosis. Secondly, adequate control of blood pressure is essential   for kidney function recovery, although this may require a long time."|"renal,hypertension,artery,malignant,secondary"|"renal,hypertension,artery,malignant,primary" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to medication and lifestyle interventions are essential  keys for the management of hypertension. In this respect, a structured  educational program for hypertensive patients has got remarkable merits  (herz.leben). In order to determine the isolated effect of participation in the  educational program, neglecting the possible impact of more intense care, this  prospective multicenter randomized controlled study was designed (NCT00453037).  METHODS: A total of 256 patients in 13 centers were enrolled and randomly  assigned to 2 groups (G). G-I (n = 137) underwent the educational program  immediately (T-0), G-II (n = 119) after 6 months (T-6). Follow-up visits were  done after 6 (T-6) and 12 (T-12) months. Primary endpoint was a difference in  office blood pressure (BP) at T-6, when only G-I had undergone the educational  program. RESULTS: Patients' baseline characteristics were comparable. At T-6,  systolic office and home BP were significantly lower in G-I compared to G-II:  office BP systolic 139 (134-150) mm Hg vs. 150 (135-165) mm Hg (P < 0.01);  diastolic 80 (76-85) mm Hg vs. 84 (75-90) mm Hg (ns); home BP systolic 133  (130-140) mm Hg vs. 142 (132-150) mm Hg (P < 0.01); diastolic 80 (75-85) mm Hg  vs. 80 (76-89) mm Hg (ns)). At T-12, when all patients had undergone the  educational program differences in BP disappeared. CONCLUSION: The results of  this multicenter randomized controlled study provide significant evidence for  benefit by participation in a structured educational program. Positive effects  seem to be mediated by better adherence and life style changes due to higher  levels of information and patient empowerment. Therefore, educational strategies   should be considered as standard of care for hypertensive patients."|"educational,program,patients,bp,office"|"hg,mm,educational,program,bp" 
"AB  - Inflammation has been shown to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and  development of hypertensive vascular injury. Neopterin is a novel marker of  immune activation produced mainly by activated macrophages. Few data are  available to show the association between neopterin and vascular function in  hypertension. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship  between neopterin levels related to arterial stiffness and endothelial function  in patients with hypertension, and their changes after blood pressure-lowering  treatment. Twenty-four hypertensive patients and 30 age- and gender-matched  healthy volunteers were recruited. Plasma neopterin levels were higher in  hypertensive patients compared with their counterparts (log-neopterin:  0.77+/-0.18 versus 0.61+/-0.16, P=0.003). Increased neopterin levels were  correlated with increased brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV; control:  r=0.659, P<0.001; hypertension: r=0.487, P=0.021), and inversely associated with   impaired brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD; control: r=-0.735, P<0.001;  hypertension: r=-0.557, P=0.005). Fifteen hypertensives received 3 months of  standard antihypertensive treatment. Three months later, their plasma neopterin  levels decreased (log-neopterin: 0.63+/-0.17 versus 0.50+/-0.19, P=0.001),  whereas arterial elasticity (baPWV: 1764+/-101 versus 1685+/-96 cm s(-1),  P=0.272) and endothelial function (FMD: 5.92+/-1.43% versus 7.73+/-1.31%, P<0.05)  were improved. The decline in neopterin levels was linearly correlated with baPWV  decrease (r=0.800, P<0.001), FMD improvement (r=0.670, P=0.006) and blood  pressure reduction (r=0.548, P=0.042). Our present study demonstrated for the  first time that neopterin is closely correlated with vascular dysfunctions, and  measurement of plasma neopterin levels might be used as a surrogate biomarker for  the clinical evaluation of vascular damage and risk stratification of future  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension."|"neopterin,levels,vascular,patients,hypertension"|"neopterin,levels,hypertension,001,patients" 
"AB  - Introduction Low birth weight has been associated with an increased risk of  hypertension in children. Less clear is whether high birth weight is also  associated with risk. We evaluated overall and age-specific risks of primary  hypertension in children and young adults associated with birth weight and birth   weight for gestational age. Methods We conducted a population-based case-control   study using linked Washington State birth certificate and hospital discharge data  from 1987 to 2003. Cases were persons hospitalized with primary hypertension at  8-24 years of age (n = 533). Controls were randomly selected among those born in   the same years who were not hospitalized with hypertension (n = 25,966). Results   Birth weight was not related to risk of primary hypertension overall, except for   a suggestion of an increased risk associated with birth weight >/=4500 g relative  to 3500-3999 g (odds ratio (OR) 1.55; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.96-2.49).  Compared to children born appropriate weight for gestational age, those born  small (SGA) (OR 1.32; 95 % CI 1.02-1.71) and large for gestational age (LGA) (OR   1.30; 95 % CI 1.00-1.71) had increased risks of primary hypertension. These  overall associations were due to increased risks of hypertension at 15-24 years  of age; no associations were observed with risk at 8-14 years of age. Discussion   In this study, both SGA and LGA were associated with increased risks of primary  hypertension. Our findings suggest a possible nonlinear (U-shaped) association  between birth weight for gestational age and primary hypertension risk in  children and young adults."|"birth,hypertension,weight,age,primary"|"hypertension,age,birth,weight,primary" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for coronary artery  disease and its underlying process atherosclerosis, but involved mechanisms are  not fully understood. Both macrophages and superoxide anions have been proposed  to play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In the present  study, we investigated whether macrophages of individuals with hypertension show   higher nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-derived superoxide  anion production compared with normotensive individuals. Furthermore, we examined  associations between macrophage superoxide anion production and the psychological  factors depression and chronic stress independent from hypertension status.  METHODS: We studied 30 hypertensive (mean [standard deviation] = 48.7 [2.4]  years) and 30 age-matched normotensive men (mean [standard deviation] = 48.6  [2.4] years). We assessed macrophage superoxide anion production using the WST-1   assay. The assay is based on the chemical reduction of the cell-impermeative  tetrazolium salt WST-1 by superoxide anions that are produced by activated human   ex vivo isolated monocyte-derived macrophages. We further evaluated whether  chronic stress or depressive symptom severity was associated with macrophage  superoxide anion production. All analyses were adjusted for potential  confounders. RESULTS: Individuals with hypertension showed higher superoxide  anion production compared with normotensive individuals (F(1,58) = 11.56, p =  .001). Complementary analyses using mean arterial blood pressure as a continuous   measure revealed that higher mean arterial pressure correlated significantly with  higher WST-1 reduction (ss = .38, p = .003, DeltaR = .145). These results  remained significant when controlling for potential confounding influences.  Chronic stress was related to higher WST-1 reduction scores, but this association  was not statistically significant (ss = .24, p = .067, DeltaR = .053); depression  levels were not significantly associated with WST-1 reduction scores (p = .24).  CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate higher macrophage superoxide anion production  in individuals with hypertension compared with normotensive individuals. This may  suggest a mechanism underlying cardiovascular risk with hypertension."|"superoxide,hypertension,higher,wst,anion"|"superoxide,anion,higher,hypertension,individuals" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been widely used to  treat hypertension and large-scale clinical studies have shown various benefits.   In this study, we compared olmesartan with azilsartan, the newest ARB. METHODS:  The subjects were outpatients who were clinically stable after cardiac surgery.  Sixty patients were randomized to receive either azilsartan or olmesartan for 1  year and were switched to the other drug for the following 1 year. The primary  endpoints were the levels of plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and  aldosterone. RESULTS: Home blood pressure exceeded 140/90 mmHg and additional  antihypertensive medication was administered to 12 patients (20 episodes) in the   azilsartan group versus 4 patients (4 episodes) in the olmesartan group, with the  number being significantly higher in the azilsartan group. After 1 year of  treatment, both angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were significantly lower in  the olmesartan group than the azilsartan group. Left ventricular mass index was  also significantly lower in the olmesartan group than the azilsartan group.  CONCLUSION: This study showed that olmesartan reduces angiotensin II and  aldosterone levels more effectively than azilsartan. Accordingly, it may be  effective in patients with increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  activity after cardiac surgery or patients with severe cardiac hypertrophy."|"azilsartan,olmesartan,patients,angiotensin,ii"|"azilsartan,group,olmesartan,angiotensin,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is involved in the  pathophysiological processes of cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies showed  that mutant ALDH2 could increase oxidative stress and is a susceptible factor for  hypertension. In addition, wild-type ALDH2 could improve the endothelial  functions, therefore reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The aim of   the present study was to explore the frequency of the Glu504Lys polymorphism of  the ALDH2 gene and its relation to carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in a  group of patients with essential hypertension (EH) and to investigate the  association between the Glu504Lys polymorphism and CIMT in Chinese Han patients  with EH. METHODS: In this study, 410 Chinese Han patients with EH who received  physical examinations at the People's Hospital of Sichuan Province (China) were  selected. DNA microarray chip was used for the genotyping of the Glu504Lys  polymorphism of the ALDH2 gene. The differences in CIMT among patients with  different Glu504Lys ALDH2 genotypes were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean CIMT of the   patients carrying AA/AG and GG genotypes was 1.02 +/- 0.31 mm and 0.78 +/- 0.28  mm, respectively. One-way ANOVA showed that the CIMT of the patients carrying the  AA/AG genotype was significantly higher than in the ones carrying the GG genotype  (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the Glu504Lys AA/AG  genotype of the ALDH2 gene was one of the major factors influencing the CIMT in  patients with EH (odds ratio = 3.731, 95% confidence interval = 1.589-8.124, P =   0.001).

"AB  - Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of endocrine hypertension  with a high frequency of cardiovascular complications. The unfavorable  cardiometabolic profile may be due to aldosterone-mediated activation of  inflammatory cells, circulatory cytokines and activation of collagen synthesis in  the vessel wall. Aim of our study was to evaluate differences in the levels of  hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha and N-terminal propeptide of collagen I (PINP) in patients  with PA and essential hypertension (EH) as a control group, and between the  subtypes of PA (aldosterone producing adenoma - APA, idiopathic  hyperaldosteronism - IHA). We studied 28 patients with PA (IHA - 10 patients, APA  - 12 patients, 6 unclassified) and 28 matched patients with EH. There were no  differences in the levels of inflammatory markers between the followed groups [EH  vs. PA: TNF-alpha (5.09 [3.68-6.32] vs. 4.84 [3.62-6.50] pg/ml), IL-6 (0.94  [0.70-1.13] vs. 0.97 [0.71-1.28] pg/ml), hsCRP (0.53 [0.25-1.54] vs. 0.37  [0.31-0.61] mg/l), leukocytes (6.35+/-1.42 vs. 5.97+/-1.29 10(9) l); APA vs. IHA:  TNF-alpha (4.54 [3.62-7.03] vs. 5.19 [4.23-5.27] pg/ml), IL-6 (0.96 [0.63-1.21]  vs. 0.90 [0.65-1.06] pg/ml), hsCRP (0.34 [0.29-0.47] vs. 0.75 [0.36-1.11] mg/l),   leukocytes (6.37+/-1.41 vs. 5.71+/-1.21 10(9) l)]. Significant differences in the  levels of PINP between PA and EH group were observed (35.18 [28.46-41.16] vs.  45.21 [36.95-62.81] microg/l, p</=0.003). No differences in inflammatory markers   were observed between the followed groups, we confirmed higher levels of PINP in   patients with PA."|"pa,levels,patients,eh,differences"|"vs,pa,patients,28,differences" 
"AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Previous studies provide links between the nuclear factor of  activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) signalling pathway and the development of  hypertension. Our preliminary studies indicate that telmisartan can block Kv1.3  potassium channels and effectively inhibit potassium current densities, along  with Kv1.3 mRNA and protein expression levels. This paper aims to investigate  whether telmisartan has an inhibitory effect on the NFAT signalling pathway after  activation and proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in Kazakh patients  with essential hypertension (EH) from Xinjiang, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T  lymphocytes were isolated using the immunomagnetic cell sorting method (MACS).  The mRNA expression of NFATc1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha was measured by quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and relative protein levels were evaluated by  Western blot. T cell samples from 50 hypertensive Kazakh patients from Xinjiang  were randomly divided into control, telmisartan, cyclosporin A (CsA), VIVIT, and   4-aminopytidine (4-AP) groups. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes were first  activated and proliferated in vitro, then incubated for 48 h under different  treatment conditions before determination of protein and mRNA expression of  NFATc1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha by Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses, respectively.  RESULTS: There were no significant differences in cardiovascular risk factors  among the patients with samples assigned to the five groups (p > 0.05).  Expression of NFATc1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA and protein was significantly  reduced in T lymphocytes in all treatment groups (telmisartan, CsA, VIVIT, and  4-AP) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive function and  inhibitory effects of telmisartan on the T lymphocyte NFAT signalling pathway are  unlikely to affect the normal immune function of hypertensive patients.  Telmisartan may exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of the NFAT  signalling pathway in the T lymphocytes of hypertensive patients."|"telmisartan,lymphocytes,patients,protein,pathway"|"lymphocytes,telmisartan,patients,expression,mrna" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: A new antihypertensive drug that selectively blocks angiotensin II  receptor type 1, fimasartan, has a potent and rapidly acting antihypertensive  effect. We investigated the antihypertensive effects of fimasartan 60 and 120 mg   and its safety in comparison to 8 mg of candesartan. METHODS: This clinical trial  is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator, and parallel group  study. Three hundred sixty-two individuals were screened, and 290 patients aged  19 to 75 years with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure  [DBP], 90-110 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to 60 to 120 mg/d of fimasartan or 8   mg/d of candesartan after a 2-week placebo run-in period. Treatments were  administered for 12 weeks without dosage adjustment. The primary end point was  the differences in DBP changes at week 12. FINDINGS: After 12 weeks of treatment,  DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased significantly in all 3 groups.  The decrease in DBP at week 12 was larger but not statistically significant in  the fimasartan 60 mg compared with the candesartan 8 mg group with a mean (SD)  difference of 1.72 (8.32) mm Hg (95% CI, -0.71 to 4.15 mm Hg; P = 0.17). The  lower margin of the CI (-0.71 mm Hg) exceeded the noninferiority margin (-3.5 mm   Hg). The DBP-lowering effect of fimasartan 120 mg was also nonsignificantly  larger than candesartan 8 mg (difference, 1.58 [8.27] mm Hg; P = 0.20). The  decrease in SBP was also nonsignificantly larger in the fimasartan 60 mg group  compared with the candesartan 8 mg group (difference, 3.50 [12.63] mm Hg; P =  .06). The SBP-lowering effect of fimasartan 120 mg was statistically larger than   candesartan 8 mg (difference, 4.98 [13.99] mm Hg; P = .02). Response rate (DBP  <90 mm Hg or DBP lowering >10 mm Hg at week 12) was also nonsignificantly greater  in both fimasartan groups (Fimasartan 60 mg, 81%; fimasartan 120 mg, 72%;  candesartan 8 mg, 71%). The safety profile of the fimasartan 60 mg and 120 mg was  similar to candesartan 8 mg, with a slightly higher, but statistically not  significant, incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation in fimasartan 120 mg.  IMPLICATIONS: The antihypertensive effect of fimasartan, a newly available  angiotensin II receptor type 1 blocker, is comparable, although not superior, to   candesartan with a good safety profile.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing evidence shows that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the   pathophysiology of essential hypertension (EH). Although it is acknowledged that   target organ damage involves an inflammatory response, most work has focused on  the role of macrophages. However, recently, platelets were identified as inducing  inflammation partly by releasing cytokines. The goal of our study was to evaluate  the role of platelets as inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of EH. METHODS:  Thirty-nine patients with EH and 30 healthy normotensive controls have been  examined. Expression of platelet CD40 was measured by flow cytometry. Serum  levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and sCD40L were measured via  a multiplexing assay. In in vitro experiments, activated platelets were  cocultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in the presence  and absence of anti-CD154 antibodies. MCP-1 in the supernatants was measured by  EIA. RESULTS: Essential hypertension patients showed significantly enhanced MCP-1  levels with highest levels in EH patients with microalbuminuria. EH patients  showed increased expression of platelet CD40. In the cell coculture model,  activated platelets were able to significantly induce MCP-1 release from HUVEC in  a CD40L-dependent manner. EH patients showed elevated sCD40L levels with a  positive correlation with MCP-1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Platelets can contribute to   enhanced MCP-1 levels in EH. MCP-1 is markedly elevated in serum of EH patients  with highest levels in patients with microalbuminuria, one early sign of renal  target organ damage. Further studies are required to test whether MCP-1 blocking   or antiplatelet strategies may represent new therapeutic options in preventing  hypertensive target organ damage."|"mcp,eh,platelets,patients,levels"|"eh,mcp,levels,patients,platelets" 
"AB  - This study aimed to assess the predictive role of body mass index (BMI), waist  circumference (WC) and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) for the incidence of coronary  artery disease (CAD) in a cohort of essential hypertensive patients. We followed   up 2266 essential hypertensive individuals (mean age, 57.8 years; males, 1083;  office blood pressure (BP), 143/89 mm Hg) who were free of cardiovascular disease  for a mean period of 6 years. All subjects had at least one annual visit and, at   baseline, underwent blood sampling and a complete echocardiographic study to  determine the left ventricular (LV) mass index. CAD was defined as a history of  myocardial infarction or significant coronary artery stenosis that was revealed  by angiography or a coronary revascularization procedure. The incidence of CAD  throughout the follow-up period was 2.33%. Hypertensive individuals who developed  CAD (n=53) had a greater baseline WC (101.1+/-11.7 vs. 96.4+/-12 cm, P=0.005),  WHR (0.94+/-0.07 vs. 0.89+/-0.08 cm, P<0.0001) and LV mass index (117+/-26.8 vs.   103.3+/-27 g m(-)(2), P<0.0001) compared with those without CAD at follow-up  (n=2213), whereas no difference was observed compared with the baseline office BP  and BMI values (P=NS for all). Using a multivariate Cox regression model, WC  (hazard ratio (HR) 1.037, P=0.002) and LV mass index (HR 1.010, P=0.044) were  found to be independent predictors of CAD. In essential hypertensive patients, WC  could predict the future development of CAD, whereas BMI and WHR showed no  independent prognostic value. These findings suggest that WC constitutes an easy   clinical tool to assess risk in hypertension among individuals with obesity."|"cad,wc,bmi,baseline,index"|"cad,wc,hypertensive,index,mass" 
"AB  - When evaluating the 'night/day BP ratio', both hypertensives and normotensives  can be arbitrarily classified into four groups: extreme dippers (ratio 0.8),  dippers (0.8<ratio 0.9), mild dippers (0.9<ratio1.0) and reverse dippers (ratio  1.0). Reverse and mild dipper hypertensives have poorer prognoses compared with  the physiological dipper profile, but the prognostic relevance of the extreme  dipper profile remains uncertain. The evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV),  obtained by 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, is the most frequently used noninvasive  form of assessment of the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Reverse and  mild dipper hypertensives have reduced HRV, indicating an overactivation of the  sympathetic nervous system (SNS); however, the HRV behavior in extreme dippers is  still controversial. The goal of this study was to compare HRV indexes of extreme  vs. reverse dipper essential hypertensives measured on the basis of time domains.  We enrolled 125 hypertensive subjects, divided in 4 quartiles according to  day/night blood pressure (BP) ratios. The upper and lower quartiles (31 subjects   per quartile) were compared; 30 normotensive subjects were enrolled as a control   group. Time domain HRV parameters of the three groups revealed a higher degree of  sympathetic activation in the lower quartile (reverse dipper) vs. the upper  quartile (extreme) and normotensive controls. HRV parameters related to  parasympathetic tone did not show any significant variations among the three  groups. Contrary to common belief, not all hypertensives have SNS overactivation."|"hrv,hypertensives,extreme,dipper,reverse"|"dipper,hrv,dippers,extreme,hypertensives" 
"AB  - Both resting blood pressure (BP) variability and exercise BP previously showed  association with incident hypertension. The aim of the present study was to  examine whether visit-to-visit variability in exercise systolic blood pressure  (SBP) can predict the risk for new-onset hypertension among normotensive adults.   We investigated 6546 normotensive men and women who were annually screened in a  tertiary medical center and completed treadmill exercise tests at each visit.  Based on the initial three baseline annual visits, long-term intervisit  variability of exercise SBP among the three tests was measured using standard  deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation for each participant. The rate of  newly diagnosed hypertension was measured in different variability levels during   6 +/- 3 years of follow-up. Multivariate analysis adjusted for various clinical  factors, including resting BP, showed that each 5 mm Hg rise in the SD of  exercise SBP resulted in a significant 5% increase in the risk for the  development of future hypertension (P = .015). Subjects in the upper exercise SBP  SD variability tertile had a 28% (P = .007) increased risk for hypertension  during follow-up, as compared with those in the lowest tertile. Similar results  were achieved for the assessment of coefficient of variation of exercise SBP. In   conclusion, visit-to-visit variability in exercise SBP can predict the  development of future hypertension among normotensive individuals."|"exercise,hypertension,variability,sbp,among"|"exercise,hypertension,sbp,variability,visit" 
"AB  - A large body of homogeneous reports documented that endothelial dysfunction,  which characterizes human essential hypertension is largely dependent on an  impaired endothelial nitric oxide availability and an increased production of  endothelium-derived contracting factors. These factors include endothelin,  prostanoids, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In particular, it was evidenced  that acute intraarterial administration of indomethacin, a nonselective  cyclooxygenase (COX)-inhibitor, and ascorbic acid, an antioxidant, normalized the  blunted endothelial dysfunction by restoring nitric oxide availability at the  level of peripheral microcirculation, thus demonstrating that COX-derived  endothelium-derived contracting factors are one of the major sources of ROS.  Recent studies put in evidence new lights on the mechanisms involved in  endothelial dysfunction in human hypertension, identified as "new conspirators."   In particular, functional and immunohistochemical experiments with selective COX   inhibitors identified the isoform COX-2 as the main source of intravascular ROS  generation in isolated small vessels from essential hypertensive patients. In  addition, important vascular protective properties by human ghrelin have been  demonstrated in human hypertension, in terms that its systemic reduction is  involved in the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction, while a normalization  of its levels may restore vascular homeostasis."|"endothelial,cox,dysfunction,ros,human"|"endothelial,cox,dysfunction,human,derived" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the second most common cause of  renovascular hypertension. Nonetheless, knowledge on the renal microvasculature  and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in kidneys with FMD is scarce. Given   the fairly good results of revascularization, we hypothesized that the renal  microvasculature and RAS are relatively spared in kidneys with FMD. METHOD: In 58  hypertensive patients with multifocal renal artery FMD (off medication) and 116  matched controls with essential hypertension, we measured renal blood flow (Xenon  washout method) per kidney and drew blood samples from the aorta and both renal  veins to determine renin secretion and glomerular filtration rate per kidney.  RESULTS: We found that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in FMD  were comparable to those in controls. Although systemic renin levels were  somewhat higher in FMD, renal renin secretion was not elevated. Moreover, in  patients with unilateral FMD, no differences between the affected and unaffected   kidney were observed with regard to renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate,  or renin secretion. In men, renin levels and renin secretion were higher as  compared with women. The renal blood flow response to RAS modulation (by  intrarenal infusion of angiotensin II, angiotensin-(1-7), an angiotensin II type   1 receptor blocker, or a nitric oxide synthase blocker) was also comparable  between FMD and controls. CONCLUSION: Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration,  and the response to vasoactive substances in kidneys with multifocal FMD are  comparable to patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that microvascular  function is relatively spared. Renin secretion was not increased and the response  to RAS modulation was not affected in kidneys with FMD."|"fmd,renal,renin,blood,flow"|"fmd,renal,renin,blood,flow" 
"AB  - Objectives Previous studies have suggested that urine albumin excretion (UAE)  mirrors generalized vascular damage; however, it is unclear to which degree UAE  mirrors small artery impairment. Design We enrolled 67 patients with  uncomplicated essential hypertension (EH) during stable antihypertensive therapy.  F-Rmin, ACR on three non-consecutive morning urine samples, pulse wave velocity  (PWV), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) were measured. Results ACR was  low (0.39 and 0.30-0.60), but abnormal small artery structure defined as F-Rmin >  mean + 2 standard deviations of normotensive value (1.99 + 1 mmHg min/(ml/100  ml)) was present in 45% (n = 30). The mean F-Rmin was 2.89 +/- 0.09 mmHg  min/(ml/100 ml). ACR correlated significantly to PWV (r(2 )=( )0.11; p < 0.05)  and pulse pressure (r(2 )=( )0.15; p < 0.001), but not F-Rmin and (r(2 )=( )0.05,  p = 0.07). Conclusions Abnormal microvascular structure was present even in EH  patients with low UAE. ACR correlated to arterial stiffness and not to small  artery structure; therefore, UEA did not reflect microvascular damage in this  population. ACR and F-Rmin thus reflect two distinct types of subclinical organ  damage in hypertension."|"acr,rmin,uae,urine,damage"|"acr,rmin,ml,artery,damage" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of plasma  aldosterone-to-active-renin ratio(ARR)in combination with plasma aldosterone  concentration(PAC)in the predication of aldosteronoma(APA). METHODS: A total of  85 APA and 155 essential hypertension(EH)patients from January 2012 to December  2014 in Chinese PLA General Hospital were enrolled. The ROC curve was applied to   calculate the optimal cut-off points of ARR for APA. RESULTS: (1)The optimal  cut-off point of supine ARR was 1  707.4(pmol/L)/(mug.L(-1).h(-1))[61.64(ng/dl)/(mug.L(-1).h(-1))] with the  sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 89.41%, 80.65% and 83.75%, respectively.  The specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic value for APA increased (89.03%  and 87.5% respectively) when supine ARR cut-off point were used in combination  with supine PAC over 329.4 pmol/L. (2) The optimal cut-off point of upright ARR  was 741.5 (pmol/L)/(mug.L(-1).h(-1))[26.77(ng/dl)/(mug.L(-1).h(-1) )]with the  sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 85.88%, 91.61% and 89.58%, respectively.  Similarly, the specificity and accuracy greatly improved (94.84% and 91.67%,  respectively) when upright ARR were applied together with upright PAC over 323.1   pmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Both spine and upright ARR can be used in screening for APA.  Moreover, the specificity and accuracy could be improved when ARR and PAC were  used together both in the supine and upright position."|"arr,apa,pac,upright,l"|"arr,accuracy,apa,specificity,upright" 
"AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether epicardial adipose tissue volume  (EATV), a new cardiometabolic risk factor, is associated with circadian changes  of blood pressure (BP) in patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension.  Ninety patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension underwent ambulatory   blood pressure monitoring for 24 h. EATV was measured using cardiac computed  tomography. These patients were categorized into three groups according to their   BP patterns (group 1, n=46, dipper hypertension, also called normal pattern;  group 2, n=24, non-dipper hypertension; group 3, n=20, anti-dipper hypertension;   group 2 and 3 are also called abnormal pattern). Data were collected  retrospectively and compared between hypertensive patients with normal pattern  and abnormal pattern. The normal pattern hypertensive patient had significant  lower mean EATV and BP ((EATV, 91.3+/-29.4 cm3) than those of abnormal pattern  patients including group 2 (EATV, 116.2+/-31.06cm3, <0.01) and group 3 (EATV,  124.8+/-28.5cm3, P<0.01). Mean systolic BP over 24 h (BPs24) and mean diastolic  BP over 24 h (BPd24) of group 1 (BPs24, 135.7 +/- 12.6 mmHg; BPd24, 83.6 +/- 10.6  mmHg) were significantly lower than those of group 2 (BPs24, 150.1+/- 17.6 mmHg,   P<0.01; BPd24, 93.2 +/- 16.5 mmHg, P<0.01) and group 3 (BPs24, 154.1 +/-  16.6mmHg, P<0.01; BPd24, 93.8 +/- 17.5 mmHg; P<0.01). Bivariate correlation  analysis showed that correlation coefficient of EATV with abnormal blood pressure  mode was 0.500 (p<0.001), partial correlation coefficient after adjustment for  waist circumference and body mass index was 0.469 (p<0.001). When multivariate  backward logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation of   BP pattern with EAT volume, it showed that the prevalence of abnormal BP pattern   (non-dipper and anti-dipper BP pattern) increased by 1.54 times after adjusting  for age and gender per additional 10 cm3 of EAT volume. Receiver operating  characteristic curve for EAT alone indicated that the cutoff value of 95.17cm3  had the best performance in predicting abnormal BP pattern with a sensitivity of   75.0% and a specificity of 72.7%. EATV was elevated in newly diagnosed and  untreated patients with non-dipper hypertension and anti-dipper hypertension.  EATV measured by cardiac computed tomography can be used to indicate the  increased risk of circadian rhythm of blood pressure."|"bp,eatv,pattern,patients,abnormal"|"pattern,bp,eatv,group,dipper" 
"AB  - Mutations in the mitochondrial genome have been found to be associated with  essential hypertension. Here, we report the clinical and molecular  characterization of a three-generation Han Chinese family with maternally  inherited hypertension. Most strikingly, this pedigree exhibited a high  penetrance of hypertension. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial genome showed   the presence of a homoplasmic T16189C mutation in the D-loop and the intergenic  CO2/tRNA(Lys) 9-bp common deletion, as well as a set of polymorphisms belonging  to the East Asia haplogroup B5b1. The well-known T16189C mutation, which is in  the first hypervariable segment of the mitochondrial control region, is  implicated to be associated with a wide range of clinical disorders. Moreover,  the genetic polymorphism 9-bp common deletion is found to be associated with  hepatocellular carcinoma in the Han Chinese population. Thus, the combination of   T16189C mutation and the 9-bp deletion may have caused mitochondrial dysfunction   and contributed to the development of essential hypertension in this Chinese  family."|"mitochondrial,hypertension,associated,deletion,t16189c"|"hypertension,mitochondrial,associated,bp,chinese" 
"AB  - The dipping variations of circadian blood pressure (BP) correlate closely with  target-organ damages and cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to  investigate the relationship between BP reverse dipping and the prevalence of  stable coronary artery disease (sCAD) in hypertensive patients. Clinical data and  the results of 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) were obtained from 718  hypertensive patients (390 males, mean age 59.6 +/- 13.8 years) in a single  centre in Northern China. Reverse dipping pattern was defined as nocturnal  systolic BP (SBP) was higher than daytime SBP. A logistic regression model was  applied to explore the independent risk factors of sCAD. The patients with BP  reverse dipping accounted for 31.5% in sCAD group and 19.5% in control group (P <  0.05). In multivariate analysis, BP reverse dipping remained significantly  associated with the prevalence of sCAD (Odds ratio [OR], 1.772; p = 0.027).  Furthermore, the circadian decline rate of SBP was independently associated with   sCAD (OR, 0.975; p = 0.043). The hypertensive patients with reverse BP dipping  were found to be more frequently suffering from sCAD. BP reverse dipping examined  with 24-hour ABPM may indicate sCAD."|"bp,dipping,scad,reverse,patients"|"bp,dipping,scad,reverse,patients" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to detect the association of the potassium  inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11) gene polymorphism  with antihypertensive therapeutic response to irbesartan in a large-scale Chinese  hypertensive population. METHODS: A total of 1,099 patients with essential  hypertension were enrolled to receive a daily dose of 150 mg irbesartan for 27  days. Pretreatment baseline blood pressure (BP) and posttreatment BP on the 28th   day were measured. Plasma irbesartan concentrations were measured by  high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence. The KCNJ11 I337V gene  polymorphism was determined using high-throughput TaqMan technology. RESULTS: The  HapMap data in the Han Chinese population showed that the I337V was used as a  representative for 4 common functional polymorphisms. Our results showed that the  association of antihypertensive response to irbesartan and the KCNJ11 genetic  variant in the total sample was not significant. However, in nonsmokers, relative  to the GG genotype, subjects with the homozygous AA genotype had a significantly   higher therapeutic response to irbesartan (adjusted beta +/- SE: 4.7+/-1.9 mm Hg,  P = 0.015). In smokers, the subjects with the homozygous AA genotype had a  significantly lower therapeutic response to irbesartan (adjusted beta +/- SE:  -5.6+/-2.5 mm Hg, P = 0.026). A multivariate linear regression model confirmed  that there was a significant interactive effect between the KCNJ11 gene and  smoking on irbesartan treatment (interaction P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The  interactive effect of smoking status and the KCNJ11 genotype may influence the  antihypertensive effects of irbesartan, which indicates a consideration for  future individualized antihypertensive drug treatment."|"irbesartan,kcnj11,genotype,antihypertensive,response"|"irbesartan,kcnj11,antihypertensive,genotype,response" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure (BP) control remains a serious concern  worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that the combination of a calcium channel  blocker (CCB) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) in patients   with essential hypertension provides effective BP control with decreased adverse   cardiac and renal events. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to quantitatively  evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed dose combination of perindopril  and amlodipine in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on a population of patients with  essential hypertension, as well as to identify the predictors of BP control in  this population. METHODS: This was an observational, multicenter, open-label  cohort study of patients with essential hypertension with or without diabetes  mellitus, treated with a fixed dose combination of perindopril and amlodipine.  Patients were followed up in four-week intervals for a total of 12 weeks. They  were initially started on the lowest dose of the ACEi/CCB combination and  up-titrated at each follow-up according to their response to treatment. The  primary end-point of the study was the percentage of patients with controlled BP   at study termination (week 12). RESULTS: A total of 1996 patients completed the  study. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)  control was observed in 93.3% of patients at week 12. As for the predictors of BP  control, it was found that female gender was associated with more BP control  [odds ratio (OR) = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.14-2.70, p value = 0.01], whereas older age  was associated with less BP control (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-1.00, p value =  0.02). Similarly, having type I and type II diabetes mellitus was also associated  with less BP control (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.08-0.45, p < 0.0001 and OR = 0.33, 95%  CI: 0.22-0.48, p < 0.0001, respectively). In a qualitative assessment, both  investigators and patients perceived efficacy and tolerability of  perindopril/amlodipine to be excellent. CONCLUSION: We found that a fixed  combination of perindopril/amlodipine is effective in controlling BP in patients   with essential hypertension, with older age, male gender, and diabetes mellitus  being independent risk factors for less BP control."|"patients,bp,control,study,combination"|"bp,control,patients,combination,study" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum  albumin levels and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24-h ABPM)  recordings in non-diabetic essential hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of  354 patients (mean [SD] age: 55.5 [14.3] years, 50% females) with essential  hypertension and 24-h ABPM recordings were included. Patient 24-h nighttime and  daytime ABPM values, systolic and diastolic dipping status and average nocturnal   dipping were recorded. The correlations between serum albumin levels and  nocturnal systolic and diastolic dipping were evaluated, and correlates of  average nocturnal systolic dipping were determined via a linear regression model.  RESULTS: Overall, 73.2% of patients were determined to be non-dippers. The mean  (SD) levels of serum albumin (4.2 [0.3] g/dL vs. 4.4 [0.4] g/dL, p<0.001) and the  average nocturnal systolic (15.2 [4.8] mmHg vs. 0.3 [6.6] mmHg, p<0.001) and  diastolic dipping (4.2 [8.6] mmHg vs. 18.9 [7.0] mmHg, p<0.001) were  significantly lower in non-dippers than in dippers. A significant positive  correlation was noted between serum albumin levels and both systolic (r=0.297,  p<0.001) and diastolic dipping (r=0.265, p<0.001). The linear regression analysis  revealed that for each one-unit increase in serum albumin, the average nocturnal   dip in systolic BP increased by 0.17 mmHg (p=0.033). CONCLUSION: Our findings  indicate an association between serum albumin levels and the deterioration of  circadian BP rhythm among essential hypertensive patients along with the  identification of a non-dipper pattern in more than two-thirds of patients. Our  findings emphasize the importance of serum albumin levels, rather than urinary  albumin excretion, as an independent predictor of nocturnal systolic dipping, at   least in non-diabetic essential hypertensive patients with moderate proteinuria."|"albumin,serum,systolic,levels,patients"|"albumin,dipping,serum,systolic,levels" 
"AB  - The objective of this study was to observe the antihypertensive effect of  losartan and levamlodipine besylate on insulin resistance in patients with  essential hypertension (EH) combined with isolated impaired fasting glucose  (i-IFG). Patients (n=244) were randomly assigned to losartan potassium tablets  (50-100 mg per day) or levamlodipine besylate tablets (2.5-5.0 mg per day) for  intensive antihypertensive treatment with no lifestyle interventions for 3 years.  The changes in fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin (FINS) and insulin  sensitivity index (ISI) from before to after treatment were observed. Blood  pressure (BP) in each group was significantly reduced by treatment (P<0.05).  After 12 months of treatment, the FINS level in the losartan potassium group was   significantly decreased and ISI was significantly increased compared with before   treatment (P<0.05) and compared with the levamlodipine besylate group (P<0.05).  After 24 and 36 months of treatment, FINS was significantly decreased and ISI was  significantly improved in both groups compared with baseline (P<0.05), and there   was no difference between the groups (P>0.05). The incidence of new-onset  diabetes mellitus was not significantly different between two groups. The  antihypertensive effect of losartan and levamlodipine besylate could amoliorate  insulin resistance in patients with EH combined with i-IFG. The improvement of  insulin resistance by losartan potassium at 12 months might be better than that  by levamlodipine besylate; however, after 24 and 36 months of follow-up, both  agents significantly alleviated insulin resistance. These results suggest that  the effects of these two drugs on insulin resistance are not significantly  different."|"insulin,significantly,treatment,losartan,resistance"|"significantly,insulin,treatment,05,besylate" 
"AB  - Primary hypertension is a growing concern in children because of the obesity  epidemic largely attributable to western lifestyles. Serum uric acid is known to   be influenced by dietary habits, correlates with obesity, and could represent a  risk factor for hypertension. Preliminary studies in children highlighted uric  acid as a potentially modifiable risk factor for the prevention and treatment of   hypertension. The effect of lifestyle changes (increase of physical activity and   dietary modifications) on blood pressure values, weight status, and serum uric  acid levels in a cohort of 248 children referred for cardiovascular risk  assessment were evaluated over a mean 1.5-year follow-up. At baseline, 48% of  children were obese and 50% showed blood pressure values >90th percentile. At  follow-up, a significant improvement in weight class (24% obese;P<0.0001) and  blood pressure category (22% >90th percentile;P<0.0001) was found. Systolic blood  pressure z-score (P<0.0001), uric acid value (P=0.0056), and puberty at baseline   (P=0.0048) were independently associated with higher systolic blood pressure  z-score at follow-up, whereas a negative association was observed with body mass   index z-score decrease during follow-up (P=0.0033). The risk of hypertension at  follow-up was associated with body mass index (P=0.0025) and systolic blood  pressure (P<0.0001) z-score at baseline and inversely related to delta body mass   index (P=0.0002), whereas the risk of showing hypertension >/=99th percentile was  more than doubled for each baseline 1 mg/dL increase of serum uric acid  (P=0.0130). Uric acid is a powerful determinant of blood pressure over time,  independent of lifestyle modifications."|"blood,pressure,uric,risk,acid"|"blood,pressure,acid,uric,follow" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: In essential hypertension (EH), 30-50% of the variability in blood  pressure is determined by genetic factors. The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2)  gene Glu504Lys polymorphism is associated with 'alcohol flush' and might be  associated with EH. AIMS: The aim of the present study was to investigate the  association of the Glu504Lys polymorphism in the ALDH2 gene with  endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) disorder in Chinese Han patients with EH.  METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 1210 patients with EH. The control  group consisted of 1089 healthy subjects with normal blood pressure. Patients  with EH were divided into normal brachial arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD)  (EH1 group, n = 354) versus endothelial dysfunction (EH2 group, n = 856). ALDH2  gene Glu504Lys polymorphism was detected using a DNA microarray. RESULTS: The  ALDH2 AA/AG genotypes and the A allele frequencies were significantly higher in  the EH group compared with healthy controls (both P < 0.05) and significantly  higher in the EH2 group compared with the EH1 group (79.8 vs 51.4%; 45.0 vs  29.1%, respectively; both P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analyses  showed that the ALDH2 gene Glu504Lys polymorphism was independently associated  with EH (dominant: odds ratio (OR) = 1.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) =  1.14-2.82; P = 0.01; additive: OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.12-2.44; P = 0.02) as well  as with EDD in patients with EH (dominant: OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.16-3.01, P =  0.02; additive: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.10-2.87, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The ALDH2  Glu504Lys polymorphism was associated with EDD disorders in Chinese Han patients   with EH, providing further evidence that this mutation and 'alcohol flush' are  not harmless in this Asian population."|"eh,aldh2,group,polymorphism,glu504lys"|"eh,aldh2,group,95,glu504lys" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is a chronic pathology that causes long-term  complications due to late diagnosis of patients, the inability to control the  disease through medication, or due to the complexity of associated risk factors.   AIMS: Our study sets out to identify specific patterns of response to arterial  hypertension treatment, by taking into consideration the multiple connections  between risk factors in a relevant population of hypertensive patients. METHODS:   Network science is an emerging paradigm, branching over multiple aspects of  physical, biological and social phenomena. One such branch, which has brought  significant contributions to medical science, is the field of network medicine.  To apply this methodology, we create a complex network of hypertensive patients  based on their common medical conditions. Consequently, we obtain a  community-based representation which pinpoints specific-and previously  uncharted-patterns of hypertension development. This approach creates incentives   for evaluating patient's treatment efficacy, by considering its network  topological position. RESULTS: Distinct clusters of patients with common  properties have emerged for each study group (group A-treated with nebivolol,  group B-treated with perindopril and group C-treated with candesartan cilexetil).  Therefore, our network-based clustering allows for a better treatment assessment."|"network,patients,treatment,based,hypertension"|"network,group,patients,based,hypertension" 
"AB  - Autonomic cardiovascular control is impaired in hypertension, leading to a  reduction in the parasympathetic tone and to an increase in the sympathetic  influences to the heart and peripheral vessels. The sympathetic dysfunction  depends on a variety of reflex and nonreflex mechanisms and participates at  development and progression of the essential hypertensive state. This has been  shown to be the case for borderline hypertension, for moderate and severe high  blood pressure, and for resistant hypertension as well. In addition, the  adrenergic overdrive participates at the pathophysiology of the complex  cardiometabolic alterations, known as "end-organ damage," detectable in the  clinical course of hypertensive disease. In the present article, we will review  the main features of the adrenergic abnormalities characterizing essential  hypertension, the mechanisms potentially involved in this neural abnormality, and  its consequences as well. We will also discuss the most recent information  achieved in the field and the areas worthy of future investigations."|"hypertension,mechanisms,participates,well,hypertensive"|"hypertension,adrenergic,essential,hypertensive,mechanisms" 
"AB  - The sympathetic nervous system plays a permissive, if not primary causal role in   the genesis and maintenance of human essential hypertension. Excessive  sympathetic nervous system activity in man is most apparent in early forms of  hypertension (prehypertension and white-coat type). Renal nerves are of  particular interest because of their roles in modulating the activity of the  renin-angiotensin system and renal sodium excretion. Renal denervation  substantially ameliorates the development of hypertension in animal models such  as renovascular, spontaneously hypertensive, and steroid-induced hypertension in   rats and aortic coarctation in dogs. In man, catheter ablation of renal nerves  has been undertaken in the late phases of hypertension; in a rigorously  controlled trial in resistant hypertension (SYMPLICITY HTN-3), renal denervation   did not reduce blood pressure over the long term. Is this because renal  denervation is more appropriate to prevent than treat late-stage hypertension?  Are there anatomical or technical barriers yet to be overcome in the procedure?

"AB  - Blood pressure (BP) usually increases upon awakening--a physiological mechanism  called morning BP surge (MBPS). BP values above the MBPS threshold are associated  with target organ damage, including left ventricular hypertrophy and proteinuria.  Despite these data, there have been no studies that have investigated the  association between elevated MBPS and the development of incident chronic kidney   disease (CKD). In this study, patients with essential hypertension were included   and underwent ambulatory BP measurements and MBPS. Patients were followed for a  median of 3.33 years. In total, 622 patients were enrolled. The mean age of  patients was 57.6+/-12.4 years, 54.0% were men, 16.7% had diabetes, and 10.6% had  prevalent cardiovascular disease. During follow-up, 32 patients developed CKD.  Higher MBPS, analyzed both as continuous and categorical variables, was  associated with incident CKD in all models. Elevated MBPS is associated with  kidney function deterioration and the development of CKD. Studies are needed to  further examine underlying mechanisms regarding MBPS and these renal outcomes."|"mbps,patients,ckd,bp,associated"|"mbps,patients,bp,ckd,associated" 
"AB  - The prevalence and effect of single-parent families in childhood-onset essential   hypertension (EH) is unknown. Children with EH and age-, sex-, and  ethnicity-matched controls were enrolled. Family structure data were obtained by   in-person interview. A total of 148 families (76 hypertension probands, 72  control probands; median 14 years) were prospective-ly enrolled in the study.  Single-parent status was seen in 42% of the families--with and without EH (38% vs  46%, P=.41; odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-1.4). After  multivariable analysis, a statistically significant sociofamilial contributor to   the development of childhood-onset EH was not identified. A significant number of  single-parent families (42%), the majority with single mothers, were found in our  pedigree study. Sociofamilial factors are known to contribute to the expression  of adult-onset EH, but findings in our study suggest that they appear to  contribute less in the expression of childhood-onset EH."|"eh,families,study,onset,single"|"eh,families,onset,single,childhood" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with left  ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) among 89 untreated children with primary  hypertension. Clinic hypertension was confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood  pressure (BP) monitoring. LV mass (LVM) index was calculated as LVM (g)/height  (m)(2.7) and LVH was defined as LVM index >95th percentile. Children with (n=32)   and without (n=57) LVH were compared. Both obesity and systolic BP were  independently associated with LVH, with a higher contribution by body mass index.  Obesity contributed significantly, with a nearly nine-fold increased risk of LVH.  There was evidence of effect modification by the presence or absence of obesity  on the relationship between systolic BP and LVH, whereby the relationship existed  mainly in nonobese rather than obese children. Hence, to achieve reversal of LVH,  clinicians should take into account both BP control and weight management."|"lvh,bp,obesity,children,associated"|"lvh,bp,children,index,lvm" 
"AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been reported to be highly expressed in  essential hypertension (EH), and it has been proposed that HCMV infection may  contribute to EH development. However, different studies showed opposite results.  The present meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between  HCMV infection and the risk of EH. All relevant literature from 1980 to 2015 was   extracted from six electronic databases. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence  intervals (CI) were used to assess the strength of the association of HCMV  infection and risk of EH. Sensitivity analysis and examination for bias were  conducted to evaluate cumulative evidence of the association. The random-effect  model using the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to give the individual  effect-size estimates. Of the 11,878 participants included in this study, there  were 3,864 EH patients and 8,014 control subjects. Meta-analysis of nine studies   performed in a random-effect model found that EH patients had a higher risk of  HCMV infection than normal control subjects (OR = 1.47, 95%CI: 1.13-1.90, P =  0.004; heterogeneity: I(2) = 66%, P = 0.002). Sensitivity analysis and bias  examination showed the overall quality and consistency of the studies to be  acceptable. For subgroup analysis, studies of Chinese populations were selected  for further analysis. There was a significant association between HCMV infection   and EH among Chinese patients (OR = 2.18, 95%CI:1.43-3.31, P = 0.0003) but not  among other ethnic groups (OR = 1.11, 95%CI:0.95-1.31, P = 0.19). These findings   provide quantitative support for the association between HCMV infection and high   risk of EH in individuals of Chinese ethnicity."|"eh,hcmv,analysis,infection,association"|"eh,hcmv,analysis,infection,95" 
"AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) mutations played an important role in the development  of essential hypertension. Mitochondrial tRNA point mutations, caused the failure  in tRNA metabolism, responsible for the pathogenesis of this complex disease. In   this study, we evaluated the possible role of the 4329C >G mutation in the  clinical expression of hypertension in a Chinese family. Analysis of the complete  mtDNA sequence variants showed that other mutations may play synergic roles in  the phenotypic manifestation of hypertension. In addition, other potential  pitfalls were also discussed in this context."|"hypertension,mutations,role,mtdna,trna"|"hypertension,mutations,mitochondrial,mtdna,role" 
"AB  - The antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)  are associated with up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)  activity. This mechanism may explain how polymorphisms in NOS3 gene affect the  antihypertensive responses to ACEi. While clinically relevant NOS3 polymorphisms   were previously shown to affect the antihypertensive responses to enalapril, no  study has tested the hypothesis that NOS3 tagSNPs influence the antihypertensive   effects of this drug. We examined whether the NOS3 tagSNPs rs3918226, rs3918188,   and rs743506, and their haplotypes, affect the antihypertensive responses to  enalapril in 101 patients with essential hypertension. Subjects were  prospectively treated only with enalapril for 8 weeks. Genotypes were determined   by Taqman((R)) allele discrimination assay and real-time polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) and haplotype frequencies were estimated. We compared the effects   of NOS3 tagSNPs on changes in blood pressure after enalapril treatment. To  confirm our findings, multiple linear regression analysis was performed adjusting  for age, gender, ethnicity, and alcohol consumption. We found that hypertensive  patients carrying the AA genotype for the tagSNP rs3918188 showed lower decreases  in blood pressure in response to enalapril. Moreover, the TCA haplotype was  associated with improved decreases in blood pressure in response to enalapril  compared with the CAG haplotype. Adjustment for covariates in multiple linear  regression analysis did not change these effects. In addition, when patients were  stratified according to the dose of enalapril used, we found that the carries of   the T allele for the functional tagSNP rs3918226 showed more intense decreases in  blood pressure in response to enalapril 20 mg/day. Our findings suggest that NOS3  tagSNPs influence the effects of enalapril in essential hypertension."|"enalapril,nos3,effects,antihypertensive,tagsnps"|"enalapril,nos3,antihypertensive,effects,blood" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effects of acupuncture method of "Huoxue  Sanfeng, Shugan Jianpi" (activating blood and eliminating wind, soothing liver  and strengthening spleen) on morning blood pressure in patients with cerebral  infraction combined with essential hypertension. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients  were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 34 cases in   each one. The patients in the two groups were treated with acupuncture method of   "Xingnao Kaiqiao" (consciousness-restoring resuscitation) and oral administration  of nifedipine. In addition, patients in the observation group were treated with  acupuncture method of "Huoxue Sanfeng, Shugan Jianpi" that met the criteria of  standard manipulation, in which bilateral Renying (ST 9), Quchi (LI 11), Hegu (LI  4), Zusanli (ST 36) and Taichong (LR 3) were selected. The treatment was given  once a day, five times a week, for totally six weeks. The improvement and control  rate of morning blood pressure in the two groups were observed. RESULTS: (1)  After treatment, the morning blood pressures were decreased significantly in the   two groups (all P < 0.05); after 15 treatments, the reduction of systolic  pressure and diastolic pressure in the observation group was superior to that in   the control group, but the difference was not significant (both P > 0.05); after   30 treatments, the reduction of systolic pressure and diastolic pressure in the  observation group was significantly superior to that in the control group (both P  < 0.05). (2) After 30 treatments, the control rate of morning blood pressure in  the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group  [82.4% (28/34) vs 58.8% (20/34), P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture method of  "Huoxue Sanfeng, Shugan Jianpi", characterized with standard manipulation  criteria, can effectively control morning blood pressure in patients with  cerebral infraction combined with essential hypertension."|"blood,group,patients,control,morning"|"group,pressure,control,blood,morning" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION Adipose tissue has been recently recognized as an endocrine organ  secreting a number of adipokines contributing to the development of  atherosclerosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, endothelial dysfunction,  insulin resistance, and vascular remodeling. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was  to determine whether treatment with a beta-blocker, calcium antagonist,  thiazide-like diuretic, or angiotensin II receptor type 1 influences plasma  concentrations of apelin, resistin, and visfatin in obese hypertensive patients.   PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 84 obese patients with essential  hypertension. One control group included obese subjects without hypertension, and  the other, lean subjects without hypertension. Patients with hypertension were  randomized into 4 groups treated for 6 weeks with bisoprolol, amlodipine,  indapamide, or candesartan, respectively. RESULTS Mean daily plasma apelin  concentrations in patients treated with amlodipine was significantly higher than   the baseline values, whereas the difference in plasma apelin concentrations in  other treatment groups was not significant. Mean daily plasma resistin  concentrations were significantly lower after 6-week treatment with amlodipine,  bisoprolol, or indapamide compared with the baseline values. In patients treated   with candesartan, no significant differences in resistin concentrations were  shown. After 6-week treatment with bisoprolol, mean daily plasma concentrations  of visfatin were significantly lower compared with the baseline values. Treatment  with amlodipine, candesartan, or indapamide did not significantly affect plasma  visfatin levels. CONCLUSIONS Antihypertensive treatment exerts significant and  varied effects on adipokine secretion in obese hypertensive patients. Changes in   apelin secretion, caused by the use of different antihypertensive drugs, may  protect the cardiovascular system and kidneys. The involvement of adipokins in  the mechanism of diverse protective effects of antihypertensive drugs,  independently of the effect on blood pressure, requires further research."|"treatment,patients,hypertension,plasma,antihypertensive"|"patients,concentrations,plasma,treatment,hypertension" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The China STATUS II is a prospective, multicentre, open-label,  post-marketing, observational study including Chinese adults (aged 18 years) with  essential hypertension who were prescribed once-daily valsartan/amlodipine  (Val/Aml 80/5 mg) single-pill combination. In order to examine gender differences  in treatment response to Val/Aml, we further analysed data from the China STATUS   II study. METHODS: A total of 11,312 patients (6456 (57%) men and 4856 (43%)  women) received the Val/Aml treatment for 8 weeks. After the treatment, we  compared the proportion of patients not achieving the target systolic blood  pressure (SBP: < 140 mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP: < 90 mm Hg) in  different age groups (by Fisher exact probability test) and estimated the changes  in blood pressure (BP) according to age and gender, using a mixed model. RESULTS:  At enrolment, mean SBP was higher in the female versus the male patients (160.0  +/- 12.71 versus 159.3 +/- 12.31 mm Hg; p = 0.003), whereas the mean DBP was  higher in the male versus the female patients (96.4 +/- 10.65 versus 94.5 +/-  10.72 mm Hg; p < 0.001). The overall proportion of women not achieving the target  BP was less than that of men (57.41% versus 59.59%; p < 0.05) at 4 weeks and  (22.22% versus 23.78%; p < 0.05) at 8 weeks after the Val/Aml treatment. Among  both men and women, the proportion of patients not achieving the target SBP  increased with age; however, the proportion not achieving the target DBP  decreased with age. The mixed-model analysis showed that the changes in SBP were   closely related to gender, indicating that the SBP-lowering effect after Val/Aml   treatment might be better in women. In addition, the changes in DBP were closely   related to age. CONCLUSIONS: Gender might be a factor for consideration in the  decision-making process of individualised antihypertensive therapy, in the  future."|"sbp,gender,age,aml,val"|"versus,age,aml,patients,sbp" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is a significant risk factor for  cardiovascular diseases. Emerging research suggests a role of DNA methylation in   blood pressure physiology. We aimed to investigate epigenetic associations of  promoter related CpG sites to essential hypertension in a genome-wide methylation  approach. METHODS: The genome-wide methylation pattern in whole blood was  measured in 11 obese patients before and six months after Roux-en-Y gastric  bypass surgery using the Illumina 450 k beadchip. CpG sites located within 1500  bp of the transcriptional start site of adjacent genes were included in our  study, resulting in 124 199 probes investigated in the subsequent analysis.  Percent changes in methylation states and SBP measured before and six months  after surgery were calculated. These parameters were correlated to each other  using the Spearman's rank correlation method (Edgeworth series approximation). To  further investigate the detected relationship between candidate CpG sites and  systolic blood pressure levels, binary logistic regression analyses were  performed in a larger and independent cohort of 539 individuals aged 19-101 years  to elucidate a relationship between EH and the methylation state in candidate CpG  sites. RESULTS: We identified 24 promoter associated CpG sites that correlated  with change in SBP after RYGB surgery (p < 10(-16)). Two of these CpG loci  (cg00875989, cg09134341) were significantly hypomethylated in dependency of EH (p  < 10(-03)). These results were independent of age, BMI, ethnicity and sex.  CONCLUSIONS: The identification of these novel CpG sites may contribute to a  further understanding of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the  development of essential hypertension."|"cpg,sites,methylation,blood,surgery"|"cpg,sites,methylation,blood,essential" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Ion transport in the renal proximal tubule (RPT), which is increased   in essential hypertension, is regulated by numerous hormones and humoral factors,  including insulin and dopamine. Activation of dopamine receptor inhibits sodium  reabsorption, whereas activation of insulin receptor increases sodium  reabsorption in RPTs, and hyperinsulinemic animals and patients have defective  renal dopaminergic system. We presume that there is an inhibition of D4 receptor   on insulin receptor expression and effect, and the regulation is lost in  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Insulin receptor  expression was determined by immunoblotting, and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was  detected in both Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and SHR RPT cells. Stimulation of D4 receptor  with PD168077 decreased expression of insulin receptors, which was blocked in the  presence of the calcium-channel blocker, nicardipine (10(-6) mol/L per 24 hours),  in cell culture medium without calcium or in the presence of inositol  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor blocker (2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate  [2-ADB]; 10(-6) mol/L per 24 hours), indicating that extracellular calcium entry   and calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum were involved in the signal  pathway. Stimulation of the insulin receptor stimulated Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase  activity, whereas pretreatment with PD168077 for 24 hours decreased the  inhibitory effects of insulin receptor on Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in WKY  cells. However, in SHR cells, inhibition of D4 receptor on insulin receptor  expression and effect were lost. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of D4 receptor inhibits   insulin receptor expression in RPT cells from WKY rats. The aberrant inhibition  of D4 receptor on insulin receptor expression and effect might be involved in the  pathogenesis of essential hypertension."|"receptor,insulin,expression,calcium,rpt"|"receptor,insulin,expression,d4,calcium" 
"AB  - The object of this work was to explore if blood based biomarkers of brain damage   could predict subclinical brain lesions and clinical outcome during follow-up in   asymptomatic hypertensive patients. This was a cross-sectional study including  101 patients with essential hypertension and no clinical evidence of neurological  disease and 53 healthy controls, followed by a longitudinal study of 62  hypertensive patients for an average of 33 months. Serum concentrations of two  brain specific proteins (S100B and neuron specific enolase - NSE) were determined  at inclusion. Fundoscopic exploration, brain MRI and echocardiographic studies  were also performed. Clinical outcome at follow-up was registered: transient  ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, vascular headache or migraine, cardiovascular  events and death. Higher serum NSE and S100B concentrations were observed in  hypertensive patients; and multiple regression analysis revealed independent  associations of clinical variables and more severe white matter lesions only with  NSE concentration. A panel combining two clinical variables (blood  pressure>140/90 and years of hypertension>10) and serum NSE>13 mug/L predicted  more severe white matter lesions with 80% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity.  Higher NSE levels at inclusion were associated not only with the occurrence of  vascular events related with the CNS (stroke, TIA and vascular headache), but  also with an earlier presentation of these events during the follow-up period.  Serum NSE concentration could be a useful biomarker to predict subclinical brain   damage and future vascular events related with the CNS in hypertension. Blood  based biomarkers could aid in filtering hypertensive patients with a higher risk   of cerebrovascular disease for brain MRI scanning."|"brain,nse,clinical,patients,hypertensive"|"brain,nse,clinical,patients,events"

We report the case of a gastrointestinal  involvement with duodenal villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltrate duodenal  epithelial and colonic secondary to the olmesartan taking with test of positive  reintroduction. The patient had chronic diarrhea with weight loss of 10kg  occurred 1 month after the passage of 20 to 40mg/day olmesartan took 3 years. A  rectosigmoidoscopy highlighted some puncture slightly erythematous areas. The  responsibility of olmesartan was suspected and the drug was stopped. The  evolution was rapidly favorable with disappearance of diarrhea 4 8hours later.  Two days after the patient took the drug on its own initiative. Sigmoid biopsies   showed an inflammatory infiltrate rich in lymphocytes. Gastroscopy showed erosive  esophagitis and duodenal biopsies showed chronic duodenitis with epithelial  lymphocytosis and subtotal villous atrophy. The reintroduction has led to the  immediate resumption of diarrhea. olmetec was finalized. Diarrhea has not  returned since. A colonoscopy performed 6 weeks after discharge was normal.  Knowledge of the bowel olmesartan is recent and based almost solely on the  description of 22 cases observed at the Mayo Clinic with patients, as in our  case, have similar symptoms and lesions.

"AB  - The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is composed of three homologous subunits and  allows the flow of Na(+) ions across high resistance epithelia, maintaining body   salt and water homeostasis. ENaC dependent reabsorption of Na(+) in the kidney  tubules regulates extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and blood pressure by  modulating osmolarity. In multi-ciliated cells, ENaC is located in cilia and  plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume  necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and  reproductive tracts respectively. The subunits that form ENaC (named as alpha,  beta, gamma and delta, encoded by genes SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D) are  members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily. The earliest appearance of ENaC  orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon, Cyclostomata  (jawless vertebrates) including lampreys, followed by earliest representatives of  Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) including cartilaginous sharks. Among  Euteleostomi (bony vertebrates), Actinopterygii (ray finned-fishes) branch has  lost ENaC genes. Yet, most animals in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish) branch  including Tetrapoda, amphibians and amniotes (lizards, crocodiles, birds, and  mammals), have four ENaC paralogs. We compared the sequences of ENaC orthologs  from 20 species and established criteria for the identification of ENaC orthologs  and paralogs, and their distinction from other members of the ENaC/Degenerin  superfamily, especially ASIC family. Differences between ENaCs and ASICs are  summarized in view of their physiological functions and tissue distributions.  Structural motifs that are conserved throughout vertebrate ENaCs are highlighted.  We also present a comparative overview of the genotype-phenotype relationships in  inherited diseases associated with ENaC mutations, including multisystem  pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B), Liddle syndrome, cystic fibrosis-like disease  and essential hypertension."|"enac,including,vertebrates,volume,orthologs"|"enac,including,orthologs,vertebrates,branch" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Microalbuminuria (MAU) is associated with an enhanced risk of  cardiovascular events. The prevalence of MAU and its prognostic impact has an  important role in the stratification of cardiovascular risk in patients with  essential hypertension. This is an observational, prospective study performed by   13 general practitioners aiming at assessing the prevalence and prognostic  relevance of MAU in essential hypertension. METHODS: Patients with essential  hypertension and with recent determination of MAU were enrolled into the study by  general practitioners, and were followed up for 3 years. Primary end point was  the occurrence of major cardiovascular events during the follow-up. RESULTS: Out   of 1024 unselected patients, consecutively enrolled from January 2009 to March  2010, 804 completed the 3-year follow-up. Patients were categorized into two  groups according to the absence (n = 523, 65%) or presence (n = 281, 35%) of MAU.  During the follow-up, 41 cardiovascular events (1.69 events/100 patient-years)  were reported. The presence of MAU was not associated with increased risk of  cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.32; 95% confidence interval  0.290-4.340, P = 0.097). When the analysis was restricted to the patients with  previous cardiovascular event, MAU (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.18; 95% confidence   interval 0.42-2.43, P = 0.031), together with age, metabolic syndrome, diabetes,   and smoking, independently predicted the occurrence of cardiovascular events.  CONCLUSION: Presence of MAU in patients with essential hypertension is not  associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events. At the variance, in  patients with previous cardiovascular events, MAU was found to predict recurrent   events. Thus, the assessment of MAU could be considered a useful tool in  secondary prevention."|"mau,cardiovascular,patients,events,essential"|"mau,cardiovascular,events,patients,essential" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the importance of the sympathetic nervous  system as assessed by urinary catecholamine measurement in the aetiology of  essential hypertension and the importance of antihypertensive therapy in the  excretion of urinary catecholamines. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour urinary  catecholamine measurement was performed in 1925 patients who were referred for  treatment of hypertension and grouped according to the Sixth Report of the Joint   National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High  Blood Pressure classification: of the 655 untreated patients, 59 were  normotensive individuals (SBP < 140 and DBP < 90 mmHg), n = 219 stage 1 (SBP  140-159 or DBP 90-99 mmHg), n = 236 stage 2 (SBP 160-179 or DBP 100-109 mmHg) and  n = 141 stage 3 (SBP >/= 180 or DBP >/= 110 mmHg). RESULTS: There was a  statistically significant positive relationship between 24-h urinary  norepinephrine excretion and the severity of hypertension, such that the higher  the blood pressure the higher the urinary norepinephrine excretion (mean +/-  standard error of mean): normotensive group, 221 +/- 13 nmol/24 h; stage 1, 254  +/- 8 nmol/24 h; stage 2, 263 +/- 7 nmol/24 h and stage 3, 296 +/- 12 nmol/24 h  (P < 0.001). The above relationship remained highly significant when corrected  for urinary creatinine, weight, age and sex. No differences were found with  urinary epinephrine or dopamine excretion. Urinary norepinephrine excretion was  increased in those patients taking single-drug therapy with either a long-acting   dihydropyridine calcium antagonist or a beta-blocker. CONCLUSION: Our results  demonstrate that in untreated hypertensive patients, urinary norepinephrine  excretion is increased in proportion to the severity of blood pressure rise and  also in patients taking a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonist or a  beta-blocker. Sympathetic overactivity may play a role in the aetiology and  maintenance of essential hypertension."|"urinary,patients,excretion,hypertension,norepinephrine"|"urinary,excretion,stage,24,patients" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between a blood pressure variability  (BPV)-based scoring system (BPVSS) and the target organ damage in patients with  hypertension. METHODS: We selected 95 consecutive inpatients with essential  hypertension admitted between January and June, 2015 in the Department of  Cardiology of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command. The BPV  indices were analyzed for their correlation with the parameters of target organ  damage (IVSd, LVPWd, baPWV_L/R, and IMT_L/R). The patients with a BPVSS of 3.9 or  higher (control, 43 cases) and those with a lower BPVSS (observation group, 52  cases) were compared for differences in IVSd, LVPWd, baPWV_L/R, IMT_L/R and the  proportion of carotid plaques. RESULTS: Similar with the traditional BPV indices,  BPVSS was negatively correlated with IMT_L/R (r=-0.278/-0.324, P<0.05). BPVSS was  also negatively correlated with IVSd (r=-0.241), LVPWd (r=-0.223), and baPWV_L/R   (r=-0.468/-0.373) (P<0.05). IVSd, LVPWd, baPWV_L/R and IMT_L/R were all  significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (t=2.307,  2.516, 3.250/2.790, and 2.372/3.425, respectively; P<0.05). The proportion of  carotid plaques in the observation group was significantly higher than that in  the control group (Chi(2)=27.833, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: BPVSS indicates the  severity of target organ damage in patients with hypertension. A greater BPV is  correlated with a lower BPVSS score and more severe damages of the heart and  blood vessels."|"bpvss,bpv,target,l,hypertension"|"bpvss,group,bapwv_l,bpv,imt_l" 
"AB  - The association of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T gene  polymorphism and essential hypertension has been reported but with controversial   results in diverse populations in Asia and Europe, thereby suggesting a  dependency on ethnicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association  between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and essential hypertension in a Cameroonian   population (Bantu ethnic group) of the South West Region. Analysis of  anthropometric and biochemical data in hypertensive and normotensive subjects  revealed that age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, and triglycerides are  independent risk factors for essential hypertension. Substitution of thymine for   cytosine at position 667 of the MTHFR gene was determined by polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Genotype frequencies were  found to be 7.3% CC, 58.5% CT, and 34.1% TT for hypertensive subjects compared to  90.0% CC, 10.0% CT, and 0.0% TT for normotensives. Allele frequencies were  obtained as 36.6% C and 63.4% T for hypertensive subjects and 95.0% C and 5.0% T   for normotensive subjects. These results reveal that the T allele predisposes  individuals to hypertension. Therefore, there is an association between variants   of the MTHFR gene and hypertension in Cameroonian patients from the South West  region."|"hypertension,mthfr,gene,polymorphism,subjects"|"hypertension,mthfr,subjects,association,essential" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a complex, polygenic condition with no single  causative agent. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of   EH, hypertension remains one of the world's leading public health problems.  Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic modifications are as  important as genetic predisposition in the development of EH. Indeed, a complex  and interactive genetic and environmental system exists to determine an  individual's risk of EH. Epigenetics refers to all heritable changes to the  regulation of gene expression as well as chromatin remodelling, without  involvement of nucleotide sequence changes. Epigenetic modification is recognized  as an essential process in biology, but is now being investigated for its role in  the development of specific pathologic conditions, including EH. Epigenetic  research will provide insights into the pathogenesis of blood pressure regulation  that cannot be explained by classic Mendelian inheritance. This review  concentrates on epigenetic modifications to DNA structure, including the  influence of non-coding RNAs on hypertension development."|"eh,epigenetic,development,hypertension,regulation"|"eh,epigenetic,development,hypertension,changes"

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the dose-related effects of  various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on  systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary  hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of  Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews.We searched the following databases for   primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (All years to 15   October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue  10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October  2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 15 October 2015).The Hypertension  Group Specialised Register includes controlled trials from searches of CAB  Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Food  Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, LILACS, MEDLINE, ProQuest  Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the WHO International  Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).Electronic databases were searched  using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for  identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008  revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms. No language restrictions   were used. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into CENTRAL, EMBASE, the  Hypertension Group Specialised Register and ClinicalTrials.gov using the  appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Full strategies are in Appendix   1. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel or  cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a beta blocker monotherapy arm with  fixed dose. People enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at   baseline. Duration of studies had to be between 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Drugs in  this class of beta blockers are atenolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol,  esmolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, pafenolol, practolol. DATA COLLECTION AND  ANALYSIS: Two authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data  independently. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3.5 was used to synthesise data. MAIN  RESULTS: We identified 56 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) that examined the  blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective blockers (beta-1  blocker) in 7812 primary hypertensive patients. Among the included trials, 26  RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross-over studies, examining eight  beta-1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly  lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In  people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP  by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The  maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose.  Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP  and DBP over the recommended dose range.Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly  lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was  evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses.  Individually and overall beta-1 blockers did not affect pulse pressure, which  distinguishes them from other classes of drugs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review  provides low quality evidence that in people with mild to moderate hypertension,   beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced  heart rate by 11 beats per minute as compared to placebo. The effect of beta-1  blockers at peak hours, -12/-9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough  hours, -8/-7 mmHg. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude  than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP  similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by  a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin   converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is  lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta-1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse  pressure."|"beta,blockers,trials,studies,hypertension"|"beta,blockers,lowered,hypertension,pressure" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: As a global measure of ventricular systolic and diastolic function,  the myocardial performance index (MPI) can be an early indicator of hypertensive   cardiomyopathy in children with essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: Children  with untreated newly diagnosed EH and white coat hypertension (WCH) by a 24-hour   ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), both groups without any identifiable  etiology for the hypertension, were enrolled for the study. Echocardiograms and  vascular ultrasounds for carotid artery intimal medial thickness were performed  on all children prior to therapy. Diastolic function (peak E and A velocities,  E/A ratio, isovolumic relaxation time, and deceleration times) and MPI were  evaluated by simultaneous transmitral and transaortic spectral Doppler flow  velocities. Systolic function was evaluated by shortening fraction and ejection  fraction. RESULTS: A cohort of 66 children (24 with EH, 42 with WCH, males 61%,  median age of 13 years, range 10-17 years) were enrolled in the study. The  demographic, anthropometric, laboratory tests, vascular ultrasound, and  conventional echocardiographic parameters were similar between the 2 groups.  There was a very small difference in MPI between the EH and WCH children (0.28  SD: 0.07 vs. 0.31 SD: 0.08, P = 0.045). However, in EH children, MPI increased by  0.14 units for every 10 unit increase in mean ABPM systolic BP (95% confidence  interval: 0.03-0.25). CONCLUSIONS: We found the increasing MPI was associated  with increasing 24-hour mean systolic BP in children with EH. Therefore, MPI may   have utility as a single, quick, noninvasive method of detection and tracking of   subclinical hypertensive heart disease."|"mpi,children,systolic,eh,hypertension"|"children,eh,mpi,systolic,24" 
"AB  - The relationship between trace elements (TE) and essential hypertension (EH) is  subtle and complex. This relationship is mediated by endothelial dysfunction,  insulin resistance, oxidative stress (OS) and athero-inflammatory state. The aim   of this study was to examine the TE impact; particularly selenium (Se), zinc  (Zn), copper (Cu) and manganese (Mn) as predictive type 2 diabetes biomarkers in   a hypertensive subject. The study was undertaken on 400 adult patients (40-60  years), who were divided in 4 groups: hypertensive (H), type 2 diabetes (T2D),  hypertensive-diabetic (HD) and healthy group. Patients were phenotyped regarding   their metabolic syndrome profile using the NCEP/ATPIII criteria. Hypertension was  defined as systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure >/= 140/90 mmHg,  respectively. The SBP and DBP measurements by electronic blood pressure using  Omron 705 CP((R)) type. Insulin resistance was assessed by Homa-IR model.  Metabolic and inflammatory parameters were determined by Cobas Integra((R)); the   TE investigated by mass spectrometric atomic absorption; the OS markers evaluated  by Randox kits. Serum Se concentrations are reduced in all groups, concomitantly   with a marked depletion GPx activity in the HD group. However, Zn levels were  decreased than in H and HD groups, but unchanged in T2D group. In contrast, Mn  levels are increased in all groups; whereas the Cu levels increased only in H and  HD groups, concomitantly with cytosolic SOD-Cu/Zn and mitochondrial SOD-Mn  depletion. The Zn/Cu ratio decreases significantly in hypertensive group but not   in diabetics groups. It appears that Zn/Cu ratio reflects the transition from  hypertension phase to hypertension associated with T2D. Ultimately, TE plays an  important role in the hypertension pathophysiology and can be considered as  predictive T2D biomarkers in hypertensive patients."|"hypertension,groups,te,zn,cu"|"groups,cu,hypertension,hypertensive,zn" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Plasma metanephrines (PMN) are highly sensitive for diagnosis of  pheochromocytoma, but the natural history of PMN before pheochromocytoma  diagnosis has not been previously described. The aim of the study was to compare   the progression of PMN before pheochromocytoma diagnosis to matched healthy and  essential hypertension disease controls. DESIGN: A retrospective case-control  Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) study. METHODS: We performed a  DoDSR study that compared three longitudinal pre-diagnostic PMN for 30  biopsy-proven pheochromocytoma cases to three longitudinal PMN for age, sex,  race, and age of serum sample matched healthy and essential hypertension disease   controls. Predominant metanephrine (MN) or normetanephrine (NMN) production was  identified for each case and converted to a percentage of the upper limit of  normal to allow analysis of all cases together. PMN were measured by Quest  Diagnostics. RESULTS: The predominant plasma metanephrine (PPM) was >100 and 300%  of the upper limit of normal a median of 6.6 and 4.1 years before diagnosis  respectively. A greater percentage of pheochromocytoma patients had a PPM >100  and >300% of the upper limit of normal compared with combined healthy and  essential hypertension disease controls <2, 2-8, and >8 years prior to diagnosis.  For patients with a baseline PPM 90-300% of the upper limit of normal, a 25% rate  of rise per year was 100% specific for pheochromocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: PPMs  elevate years before diagnosis which suggests that delayed diagnoses are common.   For mild PMN elevations, follow-up longitudinal PMN trends may provide a highly  specific and economical diagnostic tool."|"pmn,diagnosis,pheochromocytoma,longitudinal,years"|"pmn,diagnosis,pheochromocytoma,limit,normal" 
"AB  - The renal resistive index (RI) calculated by Doppler ultrasonography has been  reported to be correlated with renal structural changes and outcomes in patients   with essential hypertension or renal disease. However, little is known about this  index in primary aldosteronism. In this prospective study, we examined the  utility of this index to predict blood pressure (BP) outcome after adrenalectomy   in patients with primary aldosteronism. We studied 94 patients with  histopathologically proven aldosteronoma who underwent surgery. Parameters on  renal function, including renal flow indices, were examined and followed up for  12 months postoperatively. The renal RI of the main, hilum, and interlobar  arteries was significantly higher in patients with aldosteronoma compared with  100 control patients. BP, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urinary  albumin excretion significantly decreased after adrenalectomy. The resistive  indices of all compartment arteries were significantly reduced 1 month after  adrenalectomy and remained stable for 12 months. Patients whose interlobar RI was  in the highest tertile at baseline had higher systolic BP after adrenalectomy  than those whose RI was in the lowest tertile. Logistic regression analysis  demonstrated that the RI of the interlobar and hilum arteries could be an  independent predictive marker for intractable hypertension (systolic BP >/=140 mm  Hg, increased BP, taking >/=3 antihypertensive agents, or increased number of  agents) even after adrenalectomy. Therefore, in patients with aldosteronoma, the   renal RI indicates partially reversible renal hemodynamics and renal structural  damages that would influence postoperative BP outcome."|"renal,patients,bp,adrenalectomy,ri"|"renal,patients,bp,ri,adrenalectomy" 
"AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to compare heart rate variability (HRV) of newly  diagnosed essential hypertensive subjects with controls. METHODS: The study was  conducted on 120 hypertensive subjects and 120 controls. RESULTS: The time-domain  measures, standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the  mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals  (RMSSD), and percentage of consecutive RR intervals that differ by more than 50ms  (pNN50) which reflect parasympathetic activity were significantly less in  hypertensive subjects. In frequency-domain measures, high frequency [HF (ms(2))]   and [HF (nu)], which reflects parasympathetic activity, was significantly less in  hypertensive subjects while LF (nu) and LF/HF (%), which reflect sympathetic  activity, were comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest   that HRV is reduced in subjects with newly diagnosed essential hypertension and  the parasympathetic dysregulation is present in the early stage of essential  hypertension."|"subjects,intervals,rr,parasympathetic,hypertensive"|"subjects,hypertensive,activity,essential,hf" 
"AB  - AIM: to study effect of therapy with fixed combination of angiotensin-converting   enzyme infibitor and diuretic on structural-functional parameters of the heart  and vessels and cognitive function. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included into this  study 30 patients (20 women) with mean age 60.06+/-10.19 years, duration of  hypertensive disease 14.7 (3; 32) years, body mass index 31.19+/-3.93 kg/m2, and   without history of cerebrovascular diseases. Methods of investigation included  clinical examination, measurement of parameters of hemodynamics, electro- and  echocardiography. Vascular endothelial function and structural - functional state  of finger skin capillary network was studied by photopletismography and video  capillaroscopy, respectively. The state of cognitive sphere was evaluated with  the help of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. RESULTS: We noted  improvement of endothelial function of middle caliber arteries and  microcirculatory vascular bed (MCVB) (increase of occlusion index at the level of  MCVB from 1.4 to 1.8, p<0.00005; increase of density of skin capillary network at  rest from 45 to 52 kap/2, p<0.00007); improvement of cognitive function according  to changes of MoCA test results (from 23 to 27, p<0,0001). There were no changes   of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and electrolyte balance. Conclision.

"AB  - Essential hypertension often requires affected patients to self-manage their  condition most of the time. Besides seeking regular medical review of their  life-long condition to detect vascular complications, patients have to maintain  healthy lifestyles in between physician consultations via diet and physical  activity, and to take their medications according to their prescriptions. Their  self-management ability is influenced by their self-efficacy capacity, which can   be assessed using questionnaire-based tools. The "Hypertension Self-Care Profile"  (HTN-SCP) is 1 such questionnaire assessing self-efficacy in the domains of  "behavior," "motivation," and "self-efficacy." This study aims to determine the  test-retest reliability of HTN-SCP in an English-literate Asian population using   a web-based approach. Multiethnic Asian patients, aged 40 years and older, with  essential hypertension were recruited from a typical public primary care clinic  in Singapore. The investigators guided the patients to fill up the web-based  60-item HTN-SCP in English using a tablet or smartphone on the first visit and  refilled the instrument 2 weeks later in the retest. Internal consistency and  test-retest reliability were evaluated using Cronbach's Alpha and intraclass  correlation coefficients (ICC), respectively. The t test was used to determine  the relationship between the overall HTN-SCP scores of the patients and their  self-reported self-management activities. A total of 160 patients completed the  HTN-SCP during the initial test, from which 71 test-retest responses were  completed. No floor or ceiling effect was found for the scores for the 3  subscales. Cronbach's Alpha coefficients were 0.857, 0.948, and 0.931 for  "behavior," "motivation," and "self-efficacy" domains respectively, indicating  high internal consistency. The item-total correlation ranges for the 3 scales  were from 0.105 to 0.656 for Behavior, 0.401 to 0.808 for Motivation, 0.349 to  0.789 for Self-efficacy. The corresponding ICC scores of 0.671, 0.762, and 0.720   for these respective domains showed good test-retest reliability. The correlation  of the HTN-SCP scores and patients' reported self-management measures were  significant, except for keeping their food diary. HTN-SCP showed satisfactory  internal consistency and test-retest reliability in an English literate Asian  population. A web-based approach is feasible if similar studies are needed to  validate its translated versions of the tool for wider application in the local  multilingual population."|"self,patients,htn,scp,test"|"self,htn,patients,scp,test" 
"AB  - Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for many diseases.  Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a gold   standard for miRNA expression profiling that requires proper data normalization.   Since there is no universal normalizer, it is recommended to evaluate normalizers  under every experimental condition. This study describes the identification of  suitable endogenous normalizer(s) (ENs) for plasma miRNA expression in essential   hypertension. Expression levels of 5 candidate ENs and 2 plasma quality markers  were determined by qRT-PCR in plasma samples from 18 hypertensive patients and 10  healthy controls. NormFinder, GeNorm, and DataAssist software programs were used   to select the best EN(s). Expression levels of the 5 candidate ENs were also  analyzed in urine samples from hypertensive patients and compared to the plasma  samples of the hypertensive patients. Among the analyzed candidates,  hsa-miR-92a-3p was identified as the best EN, and hsa-miR-21-5p and hsa-miR-16-5p  as the next best. Moreover, hsa-miR-92a-3p showed the most consistent expression   between plasma and urine. In conclusion, this study showed that hsa-miR-92a-3p,  hsa-miR-21-5p, and hsa-miR-16-5p may be used as normalizers for plasma miRNA  expression data in essential hypertension studies."|"plasma,expression,mirna,ens,normalizer"|"hsa,mir,expression,plasma,5p" 
"AB  - The incidence of hypertension, the major modifiable risk factor for  cardiovascular disease, is increasing. Thus, there is a pressing need for the  development of new and more effective strategies to prevent and treat  hypertension. Development of these relies on a continued evolution of our  understanding of the mechanisms which control blood pressure (BP). Resistance  arteries are important in the regulation of total peripheral resistance and BP;  changes in their structure and function are strongly associated with  hypertension. Anti-hypertensives which both reduce BP and reverse changes in  resistance arterial structure reduce cardiovascular risk more than therapies  which reduce BP alone. Hence, identification of novel potential vascular targets   which modify BP is important. Hypertension is a multifactorial disorder which may  include a genetic component. Genome wide association studies have identified  ATP2B1, encoding the calcium pump plasma membrane calcium ATPase 1 (PMCA1), as  having a strong association with BP and hypertension. Knockdown or reduced PMCA1   expression in mice has confirmed a physiological role for PMCA1 in BP and  resistance arterial regulation. Altered expression or inhibition of PMCA4 has  also been shown to modulate these parameters. The mechanisms whereby PMCA1 and 4   can modulate vascular function remain to be fully elucidated but may involve  regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis and/or comprise a structural  role. However, clear physiological links between PMCA and BP, coupled with  experimental studies directly linking PMCA1 and 4 to changes in BP and arterial  function, suggest that they may be important targets for the development of new  pharmacological modulators of BP."|"bp,hypertension,pmca1,development,may"|"bp,hypertension,pmca1,resistance,arterial" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between autonomic nervous function and  arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: From January  2011 to December 2013, a total of 269 patients with essential hypertension  hospitalized in Chang'an Branch of First People's Hospital of Liangshan were  divided into normal PWV group (PWV<9 m/s, n=178) and high PWV group (PWV>/=9 m/s,  n=91) via the results of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Synchronic 24  hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and dynamic electrocardiogram were  performed for all participants to simultaneously monitor the heart rate  variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) in these patients. Pearson  single factor analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were  performed to define the relationship between PWV and HRV, BPV respectively.  RESULTS: The level of nHR/dHR (index of heart rate variability), 24 hour'sSSD,  dSSD, nSSD (indexes of blood pressure variability) increased significantly (all  P<0.05), while the level of SDANN (index of heart rate variability) decreased  significantly (P<0.05) in high PWV group compared with normal PWV group. Multiple  linear regression analysis showed that PWV was positively correlated with 24  hour'sSSD, 24 hour'sPP, LF, LF/HF and night/day heart rate ratio (all P<0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: HRV (LF, LF/HF, nHR/dHR) and BPV (24 hours'SSD, dSSD, nSSD) are  positively correlated to arteriosclerosis in patients with essential  hypertension. Our results show that sympathetic activation and vascular injury  are closely related in patients with essential hypertension."|"pwv,patients,variability,results,heart"|"pwv,24,patients,variability,essential" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is  associated with the blood pressure (BP) reverse-dipper pattern in patients with  hypertension. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Single centre.  PARTICIPANTS: Patients with essential hypertension were included in our study  (n=708). The exclusion criteria included age <18 or >90 years, incomplete  clinical data, night workers, diagnosis of secondary hypertension, under  antihypertensive treatment, intolerance for the 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring  (ABPM) and BP reading success rate <70%. MEASUREMENT: Physical examination and  ABPM were performed for all patients in our study. The value of RDW was measured   using an automated haematology analyser. STATISTICAL METHODS: The distribution of  RDW in patients with hypertension among different circadian BP pattern groups was  analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multinomial logistic regression was   applied to explore the associations of RDW and other relevant variables with ABPM  results. RESULTS: There was significantly increased RDW in reverse dippers (13.52  +/- 1.05) than dippers (13.25 +/- 0.85) of hypertension (p=0.012). Moreover,  multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that RDW (OR 1.325, 95% CI 1.037   to 1.692, p=0.024) and diabetes mellitus (OR 2.286, 95% CI 1.380 to 3.788,  p=0.001) were significantly different when comparing the reverse-dipper BP  pattern with the dipper pattern. However, there was no difference of RDW between   the non-dipper pattern and the reverse-dipper pattern (OR 1.036, 95% CI 0.867 to   1.238, p=0.693). In addition to this, RDW was negatively correlated with the  decline rate of nocturnal systolic BP (r=-0.113; p=0.003) and diastolic BP  (r=-0.101; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that RDW might associate   with the abnormal dipper BP patterns of either reverse dipping or non-dipping  homogeneously examined with 24 h ABPM."|"rdw,bp,hypertension,patients,abpm"|"rdw,bp,dipper,pattern,hypertension" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is considered to be a multifactorial disorder   and its aetiology has yet to be clearly identified. As the adenosine receptors  have a significant role in mediating vasodilation, alterations in their  structures or signalling pathways may be involved in the development of  hypertension. This study aimed to measure the expression of adenosine A3  receptors in a range of cardiovascular tissues and determine whether they could  be altered with essential hypertension, and to functionally test responses to  adenosine A3 receptor agonists in coronary blood vessels using the isolated  perfused heart preparation. METHODS: mRNA samples from cardiovascular tissues and  a range of blood vessels were collected from 10 week old male spontaneously  hypertensive rats and age-gender matched Wistar rats (n = 8). The Langendorff  heart perfusion preparation was used to characterise adenosine A3 receptor  mediated coronary vasodilation in the rat heart. RESULTS: Adenosine A3 receptor  agonists induced coronary vasodilation. The expression of adenosine A3 receptors   in cardiovascular tissues was altered in a tissue-specific pattern. Specifically,  down-regulation of adenosine A3 receptor expression occurred in hypertensive  hearts, which might be associated with attenuated vasodilator responses observed   in coronary vessels to adenosine A3 receptor agonists. CONCLUSIONS: This study  demonstrated alterations in the expression of adenosine A3 receptors occurred in   a tissue specific mode, and reduced adenosine A3 receptor mediated coronary  vasodilation in hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats. Our findings with  regard to changes in the adenosine A3 receptor in hypertensive hearts suggest  that adenosine A3 receptor might play a role in the physiopathology of essential   hypertension and potentially open the way to pharmacologic manipulation of  vasomotor activity by the use of adenosine A3 receptor agonists."|"adenosine,a3,receptor,hypertension,hypertensive"|"adenosine,a3,receptor,coronary,agonists" 
"AB  - Studies involving the use of prenatally programmed hypertension have been shown  to potentially contribute to prevention of essential hypertension (EH). Our  previous research has demonstrated that prenatal inflammatory stimulation leads  to offspring's aortic dysfunction and hypertension in pregnant Sprague-Dawley  rats challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The present study found that  prenatal LPS exposure led to NF-kappaB dyshomeostasis from fetus to adult, which   was characterized by PI3K-Akt activation mediated degradation of IkappaBalpha  protein and impaired NF-kappaB self-negative feedback loop mediated less newly  synthesis of IkappaBalpha mRNA in thoracic aortas (gestational day 20, postnatal   week 7 and 16). Prenatal or postnatal exposure of the IkappaBalpha degradation  inhibitor, pyrollidine dithiocarbamate, effectively blocked NF-kappaB activation,  endothelium dysfunction, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) over-activity in  thoracic aortas, resulting in reduced blood pressure in offspring that received  prenatal exposure to LPS. Surprisingly, NF-kappaB dyshomeostasis and RAS  over-activity were only found in thoracic aortas but not in superior mesenteric  arteries. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the early life NF-kappaB  dyshomeostasis induced by prenatal inflammatory exposure plays an essential role   in the development of EH through triggering RAS over-activity. We conclude that  early life NF-kappaB dyshomeostasis is a key predictor of EH, and thus, NF-kappaB  inhibition represents an effective interventional strategy for EH prevention."|"kappab,nf,prenatal,eh,exposure"|"kappab,nf,prenatal,dyshomeostasis,eh" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to be associated with cardiac   dysfunctions, such as cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension, in animal studies.  Arterial stiffness is a prognostic marker for cardiovascular disease. Previous  studies have demonstrated that 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were  negatively correlated with arterial stiffness index. The aim of this study was to  investigate the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and arterial stiffness, which  is evaluated using an ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), in patients who  have untreated and newly diagnosed essential hypertension. DESIGN: A total of 123  consecutive patients with newly diagnosed and untreated essential hypertension  were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to their 25(OH)D  levels. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined by 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/ml.  All patients were referred for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The  regression slope of diastolic and systolic blood pressure was computed for each  individual on the basis of ambulatory blood pressure readings. AASI was described  as one minus the respective regression slope. RESULTS: The mean AASI was  significantly higher in patients with 25(OH)D levels less than 20 as compared  with patients with 25(OH)D levels greater than or equal to 20 (0.50+/-0.20 vs.  0.34+/-0.17, P<0.001). In Pearson's correlation analysis, AASI had a  significantly strong negative correlation with vitamin D levels (r=-0.385,  P<0.001). In multivariate linear regression analysis, vitamin D levels were found  to be significantly and independently associated with AASI (beta=-0.317,  P=0.035). CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness measured by AASI in newly diagnosed and   untreated patients with essential hypertension were significantly related to  vitamin D levels."|"levels,patients,aasi,oh,stiffness"|"levels,25,patients,aasi,oh" 
"AB  - A comparative estimation was conducted to assess the prevalence of genotypes and   alleles of the (353)R>Q polymorphism of the coagulation factor FVII gene between   a group of the Russian adolescents with essential arterial hypertension and a  group of Russian adolescents without such health problems. The RR genotype was  diagnosed in 55 adolescents (75.34%) of the control group and in 99 adolescents  (84.61%) of the adolescents suffering from essential arterial hypertension (chi2   = 1.949, p = 0.163). The frequency of the R-allel was 85% and 91.9%, respectively  (chi2 = 3.110, p = 0.078). The role of the FVII gene in the determination of the   F7 plasma activity was defined in adolescents with essential arterial  hypertension and holders of different alleles. Holders of the R allele had  significantly higher activity of coagulation factor F7 (97.66 +/- 15.48 against  83.37 +/- 15.16, p = 0.002) and factor F2 (107.45 +/- 6.03 against 103.75 +/-  6.81, p = 0.023) than holders of the Q allele.

"AB  - The influence of a single gene on the pathogenesis of essential hypertension may   be difficult to ascertain, unless the gene interacts with other genes that are  germane to blood pressure regulation. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase type 4  (GRK4) is one such gene. We have reported that the expression of its variant  hGRK4gamma(142V) in mice results in hypertension because of impaired dopamine D1   receptor. Signaling through dopamine D1 receptor and angiotensin II type I  receptor (AT1R) reciprocally modulates renal sodium excretion and blood pressure.  Here, we demonstrate the ability of the hGRK4gamma(142V) to increase the  expression and activity of the AT1R. We show that hGRK4gamma(142V) phosphorylates  histone deacetylase type 1 and promotes its nuclear export to the cytoplasm,  resulting in increased AT1R expression and greater pressor response to  angiotensin II. AT1R blockade and the deletion of the Agtr1a gene normalize the  hypertension in hGRK4gamma(142V) mice. These findings illustrate the unique role   of GRK4 by targeting receptors with opposite physiological activity for the same   goal of maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, and thus making the GRK4 a  relevant therapeutic target to control blood pressure."|"gene,at1r,blood,grk4,pressure"|"142v,at1r,blood,gene,hgrk4gamma" 
"AB  - We aimed to investigate the thiol/disulphide homeostasis in patients with newly  diagnosed primary hypertension with a novel and automated method. Blood  thiol/disulphide homeostasis, which consists of native thiol/disulphide  exchanges, was investigated in 45 patients with primary hypertension and 45  healthy controls. The levels of native thiol, total thiol, and native thiol/total  thiol ratio were lower while the disulphide level and disulphide/native thiol and  disulphide/total thiol ratios were higher in patients with primary hypertension  when compared with those in the control group. Positive correlation was detected   between 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and  disulphide/native thiol ratio. With reference to the stepwise multiple linear  regression model; increase in disulphide/native thiol ratio and log(24-hour urine  microalbumin) and decrease in native thiol/total thiol ratio are independent  predictors of 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This study  demonstrated that thiol/disulphide homeostasis was shifted toward disulphide  formation in patients with primary hypertension."|"thiol,disulphide,native,primary,patients"|"thiol,disulphide,native,hypertension,patients" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Combination therapy is needed to control blood pressure (BP) in a  large number of hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. Adherence to  treatment is a major clinical problem; therefore, the time duration of the  antihypertensive action of a drug determines BP control when a dose is skipped.  OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine whether the fixed-dose combination of  olmesartan/amlodipine provides equal efficacy and safety as the  perindopril/amlodipine combination when a drug dose is missed. METHODS: In this  noninferiority trial with a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel  group, controlled design, 260 patients received either olmesartan 20-40  mg/amlodipine 5-10 mg or perindopril 4-8 mg/amlodipine 5-10 mg for 24 weeks. The   main outcome was the sitting office DBP after 24 weeks of treatment at 48 h from   last administration. RESULTS: The olmesartan/amlodipine combination reached  noninferiority criteria in reduction of office DBP after 24 weeks of treatment  and after the missed dose, compared with the perindopril/amlodipine combination  (-11.7 and -10.5 mmHg, respectively). Office SBP and pulse pressure were  significantly lower in both groups after 24 weeks of treatment and 48 h after the  missed dose, observing a trend to greater SBP reduction in the  olmesartan/amlodipine group. CONCLUSIONS: The combination olmesartan/amlodipine  is safe, well tolerated, and as effective as the combination of  perindopril/amlodipine in the control of essential hypertension in patients with   diabetes mellitus. A missed dose does not leave the patients unprotected in both   treatments; however, a faster control with less dose increment is observed with  olmesartan/amlodipine."|"dose,amlodipine,combination,olmesartan,control"|"amlodipine,combination,dose,olmesartan,24" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of essential hypertension with  pregnancy-induced hypertension in women. METHODS: The case-control study was  conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 2012 to March  2013, and comprised on hypertensive female patients who visited the outpatient  medicine clinics. The patients were aged 18-65 years and had been pregnant  atleast once. Cases were women diagnosed as hypertensive or pre-hypertensive and   the controls were normotensive women. The primary outcome was essential  hypertension and the main exposure was pregnancy-induced hypertension. RESULTS:  Of the 258 subjects, 175(49.7%) were cases and 177(50.3%) were controls. The  overall mean age was 44.6+/-13.3 years. Odds Ratio (95% Confidence interval) for   pregnancy-induced hypertension for the outcome of essential hypertension was 1.6   (0.88, 3.0). The odds ratio increased further to 2.5(1.2, 5.2) after adjustment  for age, family history of hypertension and physical activity. The association  remained after further adjusting for body mass index in the final model; 2.20  (1.06, 4.57). CONCLUSIONS: Women who develop hypertension in pregnancy are at  higher risk of developing essential hypertension later in life."|"hypertension,women,pregnancy,essential,hypertensive"|"hypertension,essential,pregnancy,women,hypertensive" 
"AB  - Compared to conventional echocardiography, spectral tissue Doppler imaging  (s-TDI) allows more precise evaluation of diastolic cardiac function. The purpose  of this study was to conduct s-TDI to analyze the slow movement of the left  ventricular (LV) myocardium in adolescents with systemic arterial hypertension  (HT) and to determine whether patients with HT suffer from LV diastolic  dysfunction. The study group comprised 69 consecutive patients (48 boys and 21  girls aged 14-17 years [mean, 15.5 +/- 1.1 years]) with primary HT, and the  control group comprised 48 healthy participants (24 boys and 24 girls aged 14-17   years [mean, 15.8 +/- 1.3 years]). Physical examinations, 24-hour arterial blood   pressure monitoring, conventional 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, and  s-TDIs were performed. Analysis revealed that study group participants were  significantly heavier and had greater LV mass indices than controls (P < 0.001).   There were no differences between the velocities of E waves (peak early filling  of mitral inflow), but the deceleration times of the mitral E waves were  significantly shorter whereas the A waves survived longer in the study group than  in the control group. The velocities of A waves (peak late filling of mitral  inflow) were elevated (P = 0.041), and the E/A wave pattern (E/A = 1.8 +/- 0.4)  was normal. These results suggest pseudonormalization, a type of LV diastolic  dysfunction in adolescents with HT.In the study group, when the sample volume was  positioned at the septal or lateral insertion site of the mitral leaflet, the e'   wave velocity was significantly depressed whereas the a' wave velocity was  elevated, compared to those of the control group (P < 0.001).The e'/a' ratios  from the septal and lateral insertion sites were lower, whereas the E/e' ratio  from the septal insertion site was significantly higher in the study group,  similar to that seen in atrial reversal velocity (P < 0.001).These findings  indicate that using sTDI to find and measure diastolic LV failure is valuable  when the probe is placed at the septal and lateral mitral valve annuli during  examination.Changes in the myocardium appear similar to those seen in adults."|"group,study,lv,diastolic,mitral"|"group,study,lv,mitral,diastolic" 
"AB  - There is an increasing amount of data indicating that primary hypertension (PH)  is not only a hemodynamic phenomenon but also a complex syndrome involving  abnormal fat tissue distribution, over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system  (SNS), metabolic abnormalities, and activation of the immune system. In children,  PH usually presents with a typical phenotype of disturbed body composition,  accelerated biological maturity, and subtle immunological and metabolic  abnormalities. This stage of the disease is potentially reversible. However,  long-lasting over-activity of the SNS and immuno-metabolic alterations usually  lead to an irreversible stage of cardiovascular disease. We describe an  intermediate phenotype of children with PH, showing that PH is associated with  accelerated development, i.e., early premature aging of the immune, metabolic,  and vascular systems. The associations and determinants of hypertensive organ  damage, the principles of treatment, and the possibility of rejuvenation of the  cardiovascular system are discussed."|"metabolic,ph,system,usually,activity"|"metabolic,ph,abnormalities,accelerated,activity" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: G-protein beta-polypeptide 3 (GNB3) is a beta subunit isoform of  G-protein that plays important role in signal transduction of membrane G-protein   coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GNB3 splice variant C825T (rs5443) is associated  with risk for essential hypertension (EH) and efficacy of therapeutic drugs  targeting GPCRs. It is unknown whether the polymorphism is associated with blood   pressure (BP) response to telmisartan or amlodipine, two widely prescribed  antihypertensive drugs. METHODS: A total of 93 subjects initially diagnosed as EH  were recruited and underwent a 4-week treatment with telmisartan (42 patients) or  amlodipine (51 patients) monotherapy. Both baseline and after-treatment BP were  measured. GNB3 C825T polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Baseline systolic BP   (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were comparable among C825T genotypes in both  telmisartan and amlodipine treatment groups. Patients with the CT or TT genotypes  showed significantly lower body mass index (BMI) as compared with CC homozygotes   in both groups (P < 0.05, respectively). GNB3 825TT homozygotes showed  significantly higher after-treatment DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP) than  those carrying at least one 825C allele (P < 0.01) in the telmisartan treatment  group. No difference in after-treatment SBP, DBP, and MAP levels among C825T  genotypes was observed in the amlodipine treatment group. No significant  difference in absolute changes in BP levels was observed among the genotypes in  either treatment group. CONCLUSION: The GNB3 C825T splice variant is associated  with the DBP-lowering effect of telmisartan but not amlodipine in Chinese EH  patients."|"treatment,gnb3,bp,telmisartan,c825t"|"treatment,amlodipine,bp,c825t,gnb3" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a hypertensive complication of pregnancy  characterized by novel onset of hypertension after 20 weeks gestation,  accompanied by proteinuria. Epidemiological evidence suggests that genetic  susceptibility exists for preeclampsia; however, whether preeclampsia is the  result of underlying genetic risk for essential hypertension has yet to be  investigated. Based on the hypertensive state that is characteristic of  preeclampsia, we aimed to determine if established genetic risk scores (GRSs) for  hypertension and blood pressure are associated with preeclampsia. METHODS:  Subjects consisted of 162 preeclamptic cases and 108 normotensive pregnant  controls, all of Iowa residence. Subjects' DNA was extracted from buccal swab  samples and genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0  (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Missing genotypes were imputed using MaCH and  Minimac software. GRSs were calculated for hypertension, systolic blood pressure   (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) using  established genetic risk loci for each outcome. Regression analyses were  performed to determine the association between GRS and risk of preeclampsia.  These analyses were replicated in an independent US population of 516 cases and  1,097 controls of European ancestry. RESULTS: GRSs for hypertension, SBP, DBP,  and MAP were not significantly associated with risk for preeclampsia (P > 0.189).  The results of the replication analysis also yielded nonsignificant associations.  CONCLUSIONS: GRSs for hypertension and blood pressure are not associated with  preeclampsia, suggesting that an underlying predisposition to essential  hypertension is not on the causal pathway of preeclampsia."|"preeclampsia,hypertension,risk,genetic,grss"|"preeclampsia,hypertension,pressure,risk,blood" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is proposed as a risk factor for coronary heart   disease (CHD). An inverse relation was observed between serum  25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D level and incidence of hypertension. This study aimed to  evaluate the predictive value of serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D in improvement of CHD  risk-stratification in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this cohort, we  followed 1586 patients with essential hypertension (1078 diabetic and 508  non-diabetic) for 8.5 years. Physician-adjudicated first hard CHD event was the  primary outcome. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the association   between 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D quartiles and incident CHD. 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D was  also added to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and  Net-Reclassification-Improvement (NRI) and Integrated-Discriminant-Improvement  (IDI) were used to examine improved reclassification. RESULTS: During follow-up,   176 events were recorded. Patients in the lowest quartile of 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D  experienced the most number of hard CHD events. A significant linear trend was  observed in hazard ratios (HR) of incident hard CHD events in  25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D quartiles which remained significant after multiple  adjustments for conventional CHD risk-factors (HRs in full-adjusted model: 2.87  [1.76-4.70] for 1st quartile, 2.31 [1.39-3.83] for 2nd quartile and 1.87  [1.15-3.03] for 3rd quartile, compared with the highest quartile;  p-for-trend<0.001). Addition of 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D to FRS could improve CHD  risk-estimation (relative-IDI = 15%, p-value<0.001). Addition of  25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D to FRS successfully reclassified 33% [18-49] of patients  with hypertension among CHD risk groups (p-value<0.001). CONCLUSION: We observed   that serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D is independently associated with future hard CHD   events and improves its prediction in patients with essential hypertension.  Addition of serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D to CHD risk-estimation models may have  additive values."|"chd,vitamin,hydroxy,risk,hypertension"|"chd,vitamin,25,hydroxy,risk" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MS) is widespread among hypertensive  patients. However, the net impact of MS on major atherosclerotic events beyond  the cardiovascular risk imposed by its individual components remains  controversial in this group. We sought to assess both the independent and  incremental prognostic role of MS for unfavorable cardiovascular events in a  cohort of essential hypertensives. METHODS: We followed up 2176 essential  hypertensives free of cardiovascular disease for a median period of 40 months.  All subjects had at least one annual visit. MS was defined according to the  updated NCEP III criteria. Endpoint of interest was the incidence of stroke,  coronary artery disease (CAD) and their composite. RESULTS: MS was present at  baseline in 819 hypertensives (37.6%). MS group presented increased prevalence of  resistant hypertension in comparison to MS free group (18.4% versus 10.6%, p <  0.001). The incidence of the composite end-point was 3.1% (69 events) across the   follow-up period. Patients with MS were more likely to experience major adverse  cardiovascular events (MACE) in comparison to reference category (3.7% versus  1.9%, log rank p = 0.024). While MS was an independent predictor for MACE, none  of the individual components of the syndrome was associated independently with  the endpoint. MS provided incremental discriminative value (Harrell's c, p < 0.05  for all) over individual risk factors for the incidence of MACE. CONCLUSIONS: MS   predicts adverse cardiovascular events in hypertensives incrementally of its  individual components. Early identification of MS in this population may enable  more accurate prediction of future cardiovascular risk and could implement more  efficient strategies in terms of primary prevention."|"ms,cardiovascular,events,individual,risk"|"ms,cardiovascular,events,hypertensives,individual" 
"AB  - Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is closely linked to essential hypertension (EH).   However, it remains unclear whether the methylation of the CYP11B2 promoter is  involved in the development of EH in humans. Our study is aimed at evaluating the  contribution of CYP11B2 promoter methylation to the risk of EH. Methylation  levels were measured using pyrosequencing technology in 192 participants in a  hospital-based case-control study. Logistic regression and multiple linear  regression analyses were utilized to adjust for confounding factors and the GMDR   method was applied to investigate high-order gene-environment interactions.  Although no significant result was observed linking the four analyzed CpG sites  to EH, GMDR detected significant interactions among CpG1, CpG3, CpG4, and smoking  correlated with an increased risk of EH (OR = 4.62, adjusted P = 0.011). In  addition, CpG2 (adjusted P = 0.013) and CpG3 (adjusted P = 0.039) methylation was  significantly lower in healthy males than in healthy females. Likewise, after  adjusting for confounding factors, CpG2 methylation (adjusted P = 0.007) still  showed significant gender-specific differences among the participants of the  study. CpG1 (P = 0.009) site was significantly positively correlated with age,  and CpG3 (P = 0.007) and CpG4 (P = 0.006) were both inversely linked to smoking.   Our findings suggest that gene-environment interactions are associated with the  pathogenesis and progression of EH."|"eh,methylation,study,significant,cyp11b2"|"eh,methylation,adjusted,cpg3,cyp11b2" 
"AB  - Background. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) considerably influences blood  pressure regulation through water and sodium homoeostasis. Several of the studies  have utilized anonymous genetic polymorphic markers and made inconsequent claims   about the ANP relevant disorders. Thus, we screened Insertion/Deletion (ID) and  G191A polymorphisms of ANP to discover sequence variations with potential  functional significance and to specify the linkage disequilibrium pattern between  polymorphisms. The relationships of detected polymorphisms with EH with or  without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) status were tested subsequently. Method.   ANP gene polymorphisms (I/D and A191G) were specified utilizing mutagenically  separated Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in 320 subjects including 163 EH case  subjects and 157 controls. Result. This case-control study discovered a  significant association between I/D polymorphisms of ANP gene in EH patient  without T2DM. However, the study determined no association between G191A  polymorphisms of ANP in EH with or without T2DM. In addition, sociodemographic  factors in the case and healthy subjects exhibited strong differences (P < 0.05).  Conclusion. As a risk factor, ANP gene polymorphisms may affect hypertension.  Despite the small sample size in this study, it is the first research assessing  the ANP gene polymorphisms in both EH and T2DM patients among Malaysian  population."|"anp,polymorphisms,t2dm,eh,gene"|"anp,polymorphisms,eh,gene,t2dm" 
"AB  - Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) found that several ATP2B1  variants are associated with essential hypertension (EHT). But the "genome-wide  significant" ATP2B1 SNPs (rs2681472, rs2681492, rs17249754, and rs1105378) are in  strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and are located in the same LD block in  Chinese populations. We asked whether there are other SNPs within the ATP2B1 gene  associated with susceptibility to EHT in the Han Chinese population. Therefore,  we performed a case-control study to investigate the association of seven tagSNPs  within the ATP2B1 gene and EHT in the Han Chinese population, and we then  analyzed the interaction among different SNPs and nongenetic risk factors for  EHT. A total of 902 essential hypertensive cases and 902 normotensive controls  were involved in the study. All 7 tagSNPs within the ATP2B1 gene were retrieved  from HapMap, and genotyping was performed using the Tm-shift genotyping method.  Chi-squared test, logistic regression, and propensity score analysis showed that   rs17249754 was associated with EHT, particularly in females. The MDR analysis  demonstrated that the interaction of rs2070759, rs17249754, TC, TG, and BMI  increased the susceptibility to hypertension. Crossover analysis and stratified  analysis indicated that BMI has a major effect on the development of  hypertension, while ATP2B1 variants have a minor effect."|"atp2b1,eht,analysis,rs17249754,snps"|"atp2b1,eht,analysis,associated,chinese" 
"AB  - Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. As the  studies concerning vascular alterations in pediatric patients are rare, we aimed   to study the relationship between hypertension and arterial stiffness in  adolescence by novel method independent from BP during examination. Twenty  nonobese adolescent boys (16.5 +/- 0.4 years) with newly diagnosed essential  hypertension, 20 adolescent boys (16.7 +/- 0.4 years) with newly diagnosed  white-coat hypertension, and 20 healthy controls matched to age and body mass  index were examined. Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), brachial-ankle pulse  wave velocity (baPWV), pre-ejection period (PEP), and ejection time (ET) were  evaluated. CAVI was significantly increased in essential hypertension patients  compared with controls (p < 0.05) with no significant difference in white-coat  hypertension patients. Significantly higher baPWV was found in essential and  white-coat hypertension patients compared with controls (both p < 0.001).  White-coat hypertension patients showed significantly shortened PEP and ET  compared with controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) and essential  hypertension patients (both p < 0.05). For the first time, the arterial stiffness  in adolescents with newly diagnosed essential and white-coat hypertension was  studied using BP-independent index CAVI combined with conventional baPWV. Our  study revealed significantly increased CAVI in adolescents with newly diagnosed  essential hypertension compared with controls. Our findings could help to  understand hypertension-atherosclerosis interaction."|"hypertension,patients,cavi,bp,controls"|"hypertension,essential,patients,coat,controls" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the blood pressure-lowering efficacy and tolerability of  perindopril/amlodipine fixed-dose combinations in Chinese patients with  mild-to-moderate essential hypertension not adequately controlled with  monotherapy alone. METHODS: In 2 separate double-blind studies, patients received  a 4-week run-in monotherapy of amlodipine 5 mg or perindopril 4 mg, respectively.  Those whose blood pressure was uncontrolled were then randomized to receive the  fixed-dose combination of perindopril 5 mg/amlodipine 5 mg (Per/Amlo group) or  remain on the monotherapy for 8 weeks. Patients who were uncontrolled at the week  8 (W8) visit were up-titrated for the Per/Amlo combination, or received  additional treatment if on monotherapy, for a further 4 weeks. The main efficacy   assessment was at 8 weeks. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP;   primary criterion) was statistically significantly lower in the Per/Amlo group  (vs. Amlo 5 mg, p = 0.0095; vs. Per 4 mg, p < 0.0001). Uncontrolled patients at  W8 who received an up-titration of the Per/Amlo combination showed a further SBP   reduction. These changes were mirrored by reassuring reductions in diastolic  blood pressure. The fixed-dose combinations were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:  Single-pill combinations of perindopril and amlodipine provide hypertensive  patients with a convenient and effective method of reducing blood pressure."|"patients,blood,pressure,monotherapy,per"|"mg,amlo,blood,patients,pressure" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that arterial stiffness is associated with  hypertension. Recent studies have shown that adiponectin +276 G/T, ACE I/D, AGTR1  A1166C, and eNOS E298D polymorphisms are likely to be risk factors for arterial  stiffness. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible associations between  these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and essential hypertension in a  Turkish population. METHODS: The study population consisted of 170 patients who  were diagnosed with essential hypertension and 170 sex- and age-matched controls.  Genotyping of adiponectin +276 G/T, ACE I/D, AGTR1 A1166C, and eNOS E298D SNPs  were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and commercially  produced kits. RESULTS: The percentage of the adiponectin +276 T allele carriers   was significantly higher in the patients with hypertension (33%) than in the  controls (25%, p < 0.011). Through multiple logistic regression analysis, the  adiponectin +276 T allele carrier was found to be associated with an increased  risk of hypertension (TT vs. GG and TG: odds ratio = 3.318, p = 0.014, 95%  confidence interval: 1.269-8.678). The genotype distributions or allelic  frequencies of ACE I/D, AGTR1 A1166C, and eNOS E298D SNPs did not significantly  differ between the patients with hypertension and the controls. CONCLUSION: The  present study demonstrated that the adiponectin +276 G/T SNP is likely to be a  risk factor for essential hypertension in a Turkish population."|"hypertension,adiponectin,risk,snps,study"|"hypertension,276,adiponectin,a1166c,ace" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a key enzyme involved in the  terminal steps of aldosterone biosynthesis. Genetic variability in CYP11B2 gene  has been associated with heterogeneous aldosterone production, which can affect  sodium homeostasis and thereby regulation of blood pressure. Hence, the present  study was aimed to explore the single-locus variations, haplotype and epistasis  patterns of CYP11B2 (C-344T, intron-2 gene conversion and Lys173Arg) gene  polymorphisms, and the risk contributed by them to the development of essential  hypertension (EHT). METHODS: A total of 279 hypertensive patients and 200  normotensive controls were enrolled in this study. C-344T and Lys173Arg  polymorphisms of CYP11B2 gene were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method and intron-2 gene  conversion (IC) polymorphism by allele-specific PCR analysis. RESULTS:  Single-locus analysis revealed significant association of CYP11B2 C-344T and  Lys173Arg polymorphisms with EHT (p < 0.05). Considering the sexes, Lys173 allele  was found to be at risk for hypertension in males (OR 1.40; 95% CI = 1.01-1.96).   Unphased haplotype analysis revealed H1 (T-Conv-Lys; p = 0.0017) to have  significant risk for EHT, while haplotype H4 (T-Wt-Arg) had a significant  protective effect. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) interaction  analysis found the overall best model with C-344T and IC polymorphisms exhibiting  strong synergistic effect. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a strong  synergistic effect of CYP11B2 C-344T and IC polymorphisms causing susceptibility   to EHT and haplotype H1 (-344T-Conv-Lys173) as the risk-conferring factor for  hypertension predisposition."|"cyp11b2,polymorphisms,analysis,eht,haplotype"|"344t,cyp11b2,gene,polymorphisms,analysis" 
"AB  - In primary aldosteronism (PA), insulin response to glucose is not fully  understood. Insulin action was elucidated using indices in 32 PA and 21 essential  hypertension (EH) patients. These patients were evaluated using homeostasis model  assessment (HOMA) indices, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI),  and insulinogenic index (IGI), which were expressed for insulin  sensitivity/secretion and the early phase of insulin secretion. Insulin  sensitivity and early phase of insulin secretion were decreased in PA, and there   was a negative correlation between serum potassium concentration and insulin  sensitivity indices. These findings suggest that glucose intolerance in PA may be  caused by hypokalemia-induced insulin resistance and hypokalemia-independent  impairment of early-phase insulin secretion."|"insulin,pa,indices,sensitivity,glucose"|"insulin,pa,secretion,sensitivity,early" 
"AB  - Human serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is carried by high-density lipoprotein in blood   circulation and is shown to be effective in preventing oxidized phospholipids  carried by low-density lipoprotein particles, thus it acts as an antioxidant.  Polymorphism in this gene has been investigated for many metabolic diseases, but   it is not thought to be a genetic risk factor for essential hypertension. The aim  of this study was to determine whether there was an association between PON1 gene  polymorphisms and concentration with essential hypertension. The study population  was comprised of 100 patients with essential hypertension and 100 healthy  controls. One promoter region [C(-108)T] and two coding region (Q192R and L55M)  polymorphisms in the PON1 gene were genotyped in individuals by using the TaqMan   assay. Plasma PON1 concentration in all volunteers was also measured  spectrophotometrically by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The  genotype and allele frequencies of the PON1 C(-108)T polymorphism showed  significant differences between the essential hypertensive and control groups (CT  vs. CC: p<0.001; T allele vs. C allele: p<0.001). There was no significant  difference for the PON1 L55M polymorphism between the groups, while the  heterozygote genotype of the PON1 Q192R polymorphism showed significant  difference (p = 0.03). The PON1 concentration was also found to be significantly   lower in hypertensive patients (p < 0.001). Decline in the level of PON1 gene may  be one of the main factors in the development of essential hypertension, and the   PON1 C(-108)T polymorphism may have a prognostic value in the patients with  essential hypertension."|"pon1,essential,gene,polymorphism,hypertension"|"pon1,essential,hypertension,polymorphism,gene"

"AB  - AIM: Angiotensinogen (AGT) is one of the candidate genes that has been  extensively investigated for association of its variants with essential  hypertension. Studies focusing on the contribution of tagged single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AGT gene are limited and lacking from Indian  population. Hence, the present study was carried out to examine the role of five   tagged SNPs viz., g.6147G>A (rs7539020), g.5978A>G (rs2493134); g.6241T>C  (rs1078499), g.7781G>T (rs11122577), and g.5855G>A (rs3789678) in the development  of hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 202 hypertensives and 222 normotensives  were screened for five tagged SNPs using the method of polymerase chain reaction   restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The present study  revealed significant association of g.5855G>A polymorphism with essential  hypertension in different logistic regression models wherein protection was  conferred by g.5855G>A against developing the condition. The polymorphism led to   the creation of new exonic splicing enhancer and destruction of exonic splicing  silencer site thereby enhancing the process of mRNA splicing. The haplotypes AGTG  and GACG were found to have a significant protective effect. Other polymorphisms   did not show any significant association with hypertension. CONCLUSION: The  present study is the first one to report the protective role of g.5855G>A  polymorphism in the development of essential hypertension. The results reflect  possibility of ethnic variation in the contribution of g.5855G>A polymorphism of   the AGT gene to essential hypertension."|"g,hypertension,polymorphism,study,snps"|"hypertension,5855g,polymorphism,essential,agt"

METHODS: Five thousand two hundred  and forty hypertensive outpatients without previous known diabetes were recruited  consecutively by cardiologists from >90 hospitals. Blood glucose prescription  records were collected by special investigators. RESULTS: Of the 5240  hypertensive outpatients recruited, only 258 (4.92%) were prescribed glucose  tests, and 12.17% and 42.61% of them were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and  impaired glucose tolerance, respectively. Patients' hypertension stage,  cardiovascular disease history, diabetes family history, dyslipidemia, and  hospital level were associated with higher odds of glucose tests prescription.  CONCLUSION: Glucose tests were poorly prescribed for hypertensive outpatients in   China. It was highly recommended to raise cardiologists' awareness to prescribe  glucose tests for hypertensive outpatients who were with high cardiovascular risk  factors."|"glucose,hypertensive,outpatients,diabetes,prescription"|"glucose,hypertensive,outpatients,prescription,tests" 
"AB  - Gene discovery in animal models may lead to the revelation of therapeutic targets  for essential hypertension as well as mechanistic insights into blood pressure  (BP) regulation. Our aim was to identify a disease-causing gene for a component  of polygenic hypertension contrasting inbred hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive  (DSS) and normotensive Lewis rats. The chromosome segment harboring a  quantitative trait locus (QTL), C16QTL, was first isolated from the rat genome  via congenic strains. A candidate gene responsible for C16QTL causing a BP  difference between DSS and Lewis rats was then identified using molecular  analyses combining our independently-conducted total genome and gene-specific  sequencings. The retinoblastoma-associated protein 140 (Rap140)/family with  sequence similarity 208 member A (Fam208a) is the only candidate gene supported  to be C16QTL among three genes in genome block 1 present in the C16QTL-residing  interval. A mode of its actions could be to influence the expressions of genes  that are downstream in a pathway potentially leading to BP regulation such as  that encoding the solute carrier family 7 (cationic amino acid transporter, y+  system) member 12 (Slc7a12), which is specifically expressed in kidneys. Thus,  Rap140/Fam208a probably encoding a transcription factor is the strongest  candidate for a novel BP QTL that acts via a putative Rap140/Fam208a-Slc7a12-BP  pathway. These data implicate a premier physiological role for Rap140/Fam208  beyond development and a first biological function for the Slc7a12 protein in any  organism."|"bp,gene,rap140,c16qtl,genome"|"bp,gene,c16qtl,rap140,candidate" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of miR-30 with   office and ambulatory blood pressure parameters and carotid intima-media  thickness (CIMT) in patients with hypertension and healthy controls. METHODS: We   assessed the expression level of miR-30 in 40 patients with essential  hypertension and 40 healthy individuals. All patients underwent carotid artery  ultrasonography, and office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used  to evaluate the expression level of selected miR-30. The miR-30 expression level   correlation between blood pressure parameters and CIMT was assessed using the  Spearman correlation coefficient. Multiple logistic regression analysis was  performed to assess independent association between miR-30 expression level and  CIMT. RESULTS: We observed lower expression level of miR-30 (26.01 +/- 2.40 vs.  28.26 +/- 1.28; p < 0.001) in hypertensive patients compared with healthy control  individuals, as well as in increased CIMT group compared with normal CIMT group  (25.09 +/- 1.84 vs. 27.81 +/- 2.37; p < 0.001). miR-30 expression level showed  significant negative correlation with 24 h mean SBP (r = -0.51, p < 0.001), 24 h   mean DBP(r = -0.316, p = 0.004), office SBP(r = -0.502, p < 0.001), office DBP (r  = -0.205, p = 0.068), and CIMT (r = -0.578, p < 0.001), respectively. The odds  ratio for CIMT was 0.519 (B = -0.748, CI 95% 0.278, 0.806; p = 0.006).  CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that circulating miR-30 might be used as a  biomarker for atherosclerosis in essential hypertensive patients."|"cimt,mir,expression,level,patients"|"30,mir,cimt,expression,level" 
"AB  - This study investigated the change of oxidative stress, activator protein-1  (AP-1), inflammatory, total antioxidant status (TAS) and artery stiffness, and  explored the relationship between these characteristics and the efficacy of  olmesartan intervention in elderly patients with mild-to-moderate essential  hypertension (EH). In total, 386 elderly patients with EH and 353 normotensive  controls were recruited. All study subjects had oxidative stress markers, AP-1,  inflammatory factors, TAS and brancial-ankle artery pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV)   measured. In total, 193 elderly patients with EH were randomized to olmesartan  and were matched with 193 normotensive controls to observe the change of index  above mentioned before and after the treatment. Compared with the controls,  superoxide dismutase (SOD) and TAS were significantly reduced in patients with  EH, and malondialdehyde (MDA), AP-1, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  (Hs-CRP), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), heart rate endothelin-1  (ET-1), TAS and ba-PWV were significantly increased (P < 0.01 for all). Pearson's  correlation analysis showed that SOD and TAS were negatively related to AP-1 (P <  0.05 for all), and that blood pressure (BP), age, MDA, Hs-CRP, MCP-1, ET-1 were  positively related to AP-1 (P < 0.01 for all). Multivariate linear regression  analysis showed that BP, SOD, MDA, AP-1, Hs-CRP, MCP-1, ET-1, TAS, heart rate and  age were independent risk factors for ba-PWV. After treatment with olmesartan,  SOD and TAS were increased, while BP, heart rate, AP-1 and inflammatory factors  were reduced with significant improvement in ba-PWV (P < 0.05 for all). More  increase of arterial stiffness was reported in elderly hypertensive patients with  greater oxidative stress, inflammatory, AP-1, heart rate, and lower TAS. Higher  oxidative stress, AP-1 and inflammatory may predict higher arterial stiffness.  Olmesartan may increase TAS, yet inhibit oxidative stress, AP-1, inflammatory,  and heart rate with improved artery stiffness in elderly hypertensive patients."|"tas,ap,patients,inflammatory,olmesartan"|"ap,tas,inflammatory,patients,elderly" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a complex multifactorial condition influenced by  both genetic and environmental factors; aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a key  enzyme which involves in the terminal steps of aldosterone synthesis. The result   of relationship between C-344T of CYP11B2 polymorphism and EH was controversial.   This study was undertaken to investigate the association of C-344T polymorphism  with EH in the populations of Tibetan, Dongxiang and Han from northwest of China.  A total of 2115 participants aged 18-70 years were enrolled in this study. In  total, 1776 blood samples, including 545 Tibetan (305 hypertensive and 240  normotensive), 530 Dongxiang (254 hypertensive and 276 normotensive) and 701 Han   (338 hypertensive and 363 normotensive), were analyzed successfully by using  Snapshot minisequencing method, 30 samples were also performed by direct  sequencing (5 hypertensive and 5 normotensive in each population, respectively).   The frequencies of genotype and allele of CYP11B2 (C-344T) were not significantly  different between EH group and control group in every ethnic population (p >  0.05). However, in female population of Tibetan, the frequencies of CC and CT  genotype and C allele in EH group were higher than in control (p < 0.05) group.  The frequencies of CC genotype and C allele in both the normotensive controls and  EH patients in Tibetan population were higher than in Dongxiang and Han  populations. Our study suggests that there is lack of association between C-344T   polymorphism of CYP11B2 gene and EH in Dongxiang and Han populations, whereas the  polymorphism was correlated with EH in female population of Tibetan."|"eh,population,cyp11b2,tibetan,polymorphism"|"eh,normotensive,population,tibetan,344t" 
"AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the key enzyme of the renin angiotensin  system (RAS) which maintains the blood pressure homeostasis in our body. The  association of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism with essential  hypertension has been demonstrated by many studies. The purpose of the present  study is to investigate the association of the insertion/deletion polymorphism of  the ACE gene with hypertension and additive diseases in North Indian population.   In total, 222 hypertensive and 218 normotensive adults participated in this  hospital-based study. Anthropometric measures, lipids profiles, blood glucose,  and blood pressure (BP) measures were collected from participants. ACE I/D  polymorphism was determined by using insertion-specific amplification. The mean  ages of study groups were 50.35 +/- 12.40 and 47.32 +/- 11.94 for cases and  controls, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the frequencies   of DD, ID, and II genotypes among the hypertensive and normotensive groups which   were found to be 29.7%, 38.7%, and 31.5% vs. 53.7%, 23.4%, and 22.9%,  respectively. It has been observed that the ACE ID genotype was significantly (p   < 0.05) higher in hypertensive subjects, whereas, the DD genotype was  significantly (p < 0.05) higher in control subjects. A strong association was  found between cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and ID genotype [p = 0.017, odds  ratio (OR) = 3.091, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.224-7.807]. ID [p = 0.002,  OR = 2.020, 95% CI = 1.281-3.185] and II [p = 0.032, OR = 1.677, 95% CI =  1.044-2.694] genotypes are more prone to diabetes with hypertension. This finding  suggests that ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with hypertension  and additive diseases in North Indians."|"ace,id,hypertension,study,insertion"|"ace,hypertension,id,insertion,polymorphism" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of miR155 with   office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) parameters and left ventricular  hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and healthy controls. METHODS: We  assessed the expression level of the miR155 in 50 patients with essential  hypertension and 30 healthy individuals. All patients underwent two-dimensional  echocardiography, office BP monitoring and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring  (ABPM). Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)  was used to evaluate the expression of selected miR155. The miR155 correlations  between BP parameters and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were assessed using   the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: We observed higher expression  level of miR155 (33.22 +/- 2.59 vs. 27.30 +/- 1.76; p < 0.001) in hypertensive  patients compared with healthy control individuals, as well as in LVH to nLVH  group (33.00 +/- 2.78 vs. 27.28 +/- 1.76; p < 0.001). MiR155 expression level  showed significant positive correlations with office measurement of systolic  blood pressure (SBP) (r = 0.634, p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r =   0.222, p < 0.05), pulse pressure (PP) (r = 0.564, p < 0.001), respectively. And  explored miR155 expression level in relation to 24-h ABPM parameters showed  significant positive correlation with 24 h mean SBP (r = 0.67, p < 0.001), 24 h  mean DBP (r = 0.257, p < 0.05), 24 h mean PP (r = 0.597, p < 0.001),  respectively, as well as with LVMI (r = 0.591, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:  Circulating miR155 may possibly represent potential non-invasive marker of  hypertension and target organ damage (TOD) in essential hypertensive patients."|"mir155,expression,patients,pressure,office"|"mir155,001,expression,patients,pressure" 
"AB  - Hypertension is a major public health problem in the developing as well as in  developed countries due to its high prevalence and its association with coronary   heart disease, renal disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and related  disorders. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this  disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However,   a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as  age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Recent  advances in molecular biological research had achieved clarifying the molecular  basis of Mendelian hypertensive disorders. Molecular genetic studies have now  identified mutations in several genes that cause Mendelian forms of hypertension   in humans. However, none of the single genetic variants has emerged from linkage   or association analyses as consistently related to the blood pressure level in  every sample and in all populations. Besides, a number of polymorphisms in  candidate genes have been associated with differences in blood pressure. The most  prominent candidate has been the polymorphisms in the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In total, EH is likely to be a polygenic  disorder that results from inheritance of a number of susceptibility genes and  involves multiple environmental determinants. These determinants complicate the  study of blood pressure variations in the general population. The complex nature   of the hypertension phenotype makes large-scale studies indispensable, when  screening of familial and genetic factors was intended. In this review, recent  genetic studies exploring the molecular basis of EH, including different  molecular pathways, are highlighted."|"eh,genetic,hypertension,genes,molecular"|"genetic,molecular,disease,eh,hypertension" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the related factors of serum uric acid in patients with  primary hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia. METHODS: One hundred and ten  patients with primary hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia (homocysteine levels   >10 mumol/L) were enrolled into this study, ages from 18 years to 75 years. They   were divided into the normal serum uric acid group which contained 74 cases  patients (41 cases of male and 33 cases of female) and the hyperuricemia group  which contained 36 cases patients (20 cases of male and 16 cases of female).  Plasma concentrations of homocysteine, serum uric acid, serum folic acid, blood  sugar, triglyceride, total cholesterol, serum low density lipoprotein  cholesterol, serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, and  creatinine were detected in these patients, and the deference of them between the  two groups was compared. And then the risk factors of serum uric acid with  univariate analysis and multivariate analysis by logistic regression analysis  were analyzed. RESULTS: The result of multivariate analysis showed that the  incidence of serum uric acid in patients with primary hypertension and  hyperhomocysteinemia had significant relationships with systolic blood pressure  (OR [odds ratio]: 1.132, 95%CI [confidence interval]: 1.003~1.290, p = 0.043),  diastolic blood pressure (OR: 1.353 95%CI: 1.023~1.789, p = 0.034, homocysteine  (OR: 1.264, 95%CI: 1.016~1.573, p = 0.035), triglyceride (OR: 9.726, 95%CI:  1.288~73.466, p = 0.027), and creatinine (OR: 1.031, 95%CI: 1.005~1.508, p =  0.018). CONCLUSION: The indices of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood  pressure, homocysteine, triglyceride, and creatinine were important risk factors   of serum uric acid in patients with primary hypertension and  hyperhomocysteinemia. It is of great significance to measure multiple risk  factors in patients with primary hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia."|"serum,patients,blood,acid,uric"|"serum,patients,acid,blood,cases" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: High-altitude essential hypertension (HAEH) is a  disease occurring in permanent residents of high-altitude regions. The disease is  characterized with SBP >/=140 mmHg and DBP >/=90 mmHg. HAEH is known to run in  families, i.e. the disease has genetic component. Rho-associated coiled-coil  containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) is a stress-activated serine-threonine kinase  known to disturb vascular-homeostasis leading to an increase in systemic vascular  resistance, hallmark of HAEH. ROCK2 is implicated in sea-level essential  hypertension but its role in HAEH is yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The present  study deals with genotyping 13 polymorphisms of ROCK2 gene in demographicaly  matched human cases (n = 65) and controls (n = 38) by Sequenom MS (TOF)-based  MassARRAY platform using iPLEX Gold technology. RESULTS: A significant  association was observed for GG genotype (SNP, rs978906), AA genotype (SNP,  rs6753921), GG genotype (SNP, rs10495582) and AA genotype (SNP, rs2230774) with  HAEH (p < 0.05). The 4 SNPs were tagged to each other and formed a 35 kb LD block  (r(2 )> 0.90). Haplotype AGCC, composed of wild-type alleles of the SNPs was over  represented in controls. In contrast, haplotype GAGA, composed of variant-alleles  was observed to be in higher proportion in cases. Moreover, SBP levels (mmHg)  were higher in cases with risk genotype against the ones having protective  genotype (p = 0.05). Bioinformatic analysis revealed binding of a critical  transcription factor, SRF to variant-allele G of SNP rs10495582. SRF has been  reported in previous studies to promote ROCK2 transcriptional expression.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The data clearly suggests association of ROCK2  polymorphisms and haplotypes with HAEH."|"haeh,rock2,genotype,cases,disease"|"genotype,haeh,rock2,snp,cases" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed at evaluating the relationship between the circadian blood  pressure rhythm and UA level in young patients (30-40 years old) with newly  diagnosed essential hypertension. METHODS: The study included 62 essential  hypertensive patients and 29 healthy controls (20 men, 35 +/- 3 years) divided  into two groups according to 24-hour ABPM results: 30 dippers and 32 nondippers.   RESULTS: Nondippers showed significantly higher both serum UA levels compared to   dippers and controls (6.1 +/- 0.7, 5.2 +/- 0.9 and 4.1 +/- 0.9 mg/dL, p < 0.001,   respectively); and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (4.1 +/- 2.2 mg/L,  3.3 +/- 1.9 mg/L, and 1.4 +/- 0.9 mg/L, p < 0.001, respectively). After adjusting  for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, creatinine levels, hsCRP and comorbidity,  multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an independent association  between serum UA levels and nondipper pattern (OR 2.44, 95%CIs 1.4-4.1, p =  0.002). CONCLUSION: Serum UA is independently associated with nondipper circadian  pattern in young patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension."|"ua,levels,patients,serum,hscrp"|"mg,ua,essential,levels,patients" 
"AB  - This 56-week phase 3, open-label, treat-to-target study, involving 2 consecutive,  non-randomized cohorts, evaluated the safety and tolerability of azilsartan  medoxomil (AZL-M) in essential hypertension (mean baseline blood pressure [BP]  152/100 mmHg). All subjects (n = 669) initiated AZL-M 40 mg QD, force-titrated to  80 mg QD at week 4, if tolerated. From week 8, subjects could receive additional   medications, starting with chlorthalidone (CLD) 25 mg QD (Cohort 1) or  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5-25 mg QD (Cohort 2), if required, to reach BP  targets. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 75.9% of subjects overall in the  two cohorts (73.8% Cohort 1, 78.5% Cohort 2). The most common AEs were dizziness   (14.3%), headache (9.9%) and fatigue (7.2%). Transient serum creatinine  elevations were more frequent with add-on CLD. Clinic systolic/diastolic BP  (observed cases at week 56) decreased by 25.2/18.4 mmHg (Cohort 1) and 24.2/17.9   mmHg (Cohort 2). These results demonstrate that AZL-M is well tolerated over the   long term and provides stable BP improvements when used in a treat-to-target BP  approach with thiazide-type diuretics."|"bp,cohort,azl,week,subjects"|"cohort,bp,mg,qd,week" 
"AB  - A change in sleep architecture might increase the risk of hypertension and worsen  target organs. This study thus aimed to study the features of sleep architecture   and examine its relationship with pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of  arterial stiffness, in patients with essential hypertension and healthy people  aged 45-65 years (n = 106). We collected data on demographics, the serum index,  overnight polysomnography, vascular testing and ambulatory blood pressure in  addition to measuring arterial stiffness and monitoring sleep respiration. We  found that patients with hypertension had longer sleep latency and shorter  duration. Their sleep efficiency and the ratio of N3 in non-rapid eye movement  (NREM) and rapid eye movement were lower, while the micro-arousal index (MI), N1   and N2 in NREM, and the apnea-hypopnea index were higher than normal people in  controls. PWV raised with a decrease in N3 and an increase in the MI. In summary,  there were notable changes in sleep architecture and with a decrease in N3 and  increase in MI can accelerate arterial stiffness and then worsen target organ  damage in patients with hypertension."|"sleep,index,hypertension,arterial,stiffness"|"sleep,hypertension,architecture,arterial,increase" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the synergistic effects of gene polymorphisms of the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on essential hypertension (EH) in  Kazakhs in Xinjiang. METHODS: A cross-sectional case-control association study  was conducted in 52 1 hypertensive and 623 normotensive subjects of Kazakh  ethnicity on eight common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) interspersed  over five genes of the RAAS. SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Interactions among the SNPs  were analyzed by the multifactor dimensionality reduction method (MDR). RESULTS:   In single-locus analysis, subjects with AGT -6G, ACE D, and CYP11B2 -344C had  increased susceptibility to EH (OR: 1.249; 1.425; 1.201). When subgrouped by sex,  males with the t allele of REN Taq I had decreased risk for EH (OR: 0.529), and  those with AGT -6G and CYP11B2 -344 C had increased risk for EH (OR: 1.498;  1.449). In females, carrying ACE D increased the risk for EH. (OR: 1.327). In six  AGT haplotypes, H1 was protective, while H3 increased susceptibility to EH (OR:  0.683; 2.025). Interaction analysis by MDR showed that there was a strong  synergistic effect between ACE I/D and CY11B2 (T-344C) and a moderate interaction  between both ACE I/D and CY11B2 T-344C and AGT A-6G. CONCLUSIONS: There was a  strong synergistic effect between ACE I/D and CY11B2 T-344C and a moderate effect  between both ACE I/D and CY11B2 T-344C and AGT A-6G. AGT -6G, ACE D, and CY11B2  -344C increased susceptibility to EH. REN Taq I, AGT -6G, CY11B2 -344 C and ACE D  were associated with male and female EH, respectively. H1 and H3 of AGT were  protective and risk haplotypes, respectively."|"eh,snps,agt,ace,risk"|"ace,agt,eh,344c,6g" 
"AB  - The article represents literature review and provides evidence for psychological   stress to play essential role in the development of arterial hypertension. The  pathogenesis of hypertension is complex with a significant diversity and  variability of the mechanisms involved in individual patient. In this regard, the  determination of specific pathogenic pathways underlying sustained blood pressure  elevation in each patient would substantially individualize therapeutic  approaches, and hence increase the effectiveness of treatment. Psychological  stress is proposed as a significant factor contributing to the development of  hypertension. Global urbanization, sedentary lifestyle, daily stress at  workplace, lack of physical activity and social support lead to increased  anxiety, uncertainty, and finally to chronic mental and emotional stress. This  review provides information about alterations in neuroendocrine and immune  systems as the main pathogenic pathways linking psychological stress and  hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is considered not only as a consequence but  also a primary factor causing prohypertensive state. Moreover, physical  inactivity is discussed as one of the plausible mechanisms playing a key role in   the development of hypertension in modern lifestyle conditions. Particularly the   loss of connection between psychosocial strain and physical activity may underlie  the deleterious effect of stress on cardiovascular and metabolic health."|"stress,hypertension,physical,psychological,development"|"stress,hypertension,development,physical,psychological" 
"AB  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) antibody  status, and hypertension and functional status among elderly Koreans. METHODS:  Patients aged >/=65 years were prospectively enrolled from March 2011 to February  2012 at a 2000-bed university hospital. We collected data including CD4+ and CD8+  T-lymphocyte count, and functional status by measuring basic activities of daily   living and instrumental activities of daily living for all patients. In addition,  HCMV immunoglobulin G levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay.  RESULTS: During the study period, 103 patients (51 men), who were admitted for  treatment of infections or other diseases, were enrolled. Multivariate analysis  showed that body mass index and HCMV immunoglobulin G antibody titers were  independent factors associated with hypertension in elderly patients (OR 1.347,  95% CI 1.113-1.630, P = 0.002; OR 1.023, 95% CI 1.001-1.047, P = 0.042,  respectively). In univariate linear correlations, HCMV antibody levels were  positively correlated with systolic blood pressure levels (r = 0.303, P = 0.002),  CD8+ T-lymphocyte count (r = 0.313, P = 0.001) and instrumental activities of  daily living scores (r = 0.217, P = 0.028). In addition, HCMV immunoglobulin G  titers were inversely associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r =  -0.268, P = 0.006). These four variables remained independently significant in  multivariate correlation analysis. CONCLUSION: These findings could provide  insight into the important role of HCMV in the pathogenesis of essential  hypertension and decreased functional status in the elderly."|"hcmv,patients,antibody,status,levels"|"hcmv,patients,status,activities,antibody" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitofusion-2 (Mfn2) played an important role in regulating vascular  smooth muscle cells proliferation, insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum  stress, which were found to be involved in the development of hypertension. So we  inferred that the Mfn2 gene may participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension.   The aim of this study was to determine whether common single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in Mfn2 gene were associated with essential hypertension  (EH) in northern Han Chinese. METHODS: We genotyped 6 tagging SNPs of Mfn2 gene  (rs2336384, rs2295281, rs17037564, rs2236057, rs2236058 and rs3766741) with the  TaqMan assay in 626 hypertensive patients and 618 controls. RESULTS: Logistic  regression analysis indicated that CC+CA genotype of rs2336384 and AA+AG genotype  of rs2236057 were significantly associated with increased risk of EH (OR=1.617,  P=0.005; OR=1.418, P=0.031, respectively). GG genotype of rs2236058 and GG+CG  genotype of rs3766741 were found to be significantly associated with decreased  risk of EH (OR=0.662, P=0.023; OR=0.639, P=0.024).When stratified by gender, for   rs2336384, rs2236057 and rs2236058, significant association was observed in  males, but not in females. Haplotype analysis indicated that the CCAACC haplotype  was positively correlated with EH and there was a negative correlation between  ACAGGG haplotype and EH. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that Mfn2 gene  polymorphisms were associated with essential hypertension in northern Han Chinese  population, especially in male subjects."|"mfn2,eh,hypertension,rs2236057,gene"|"eh,mfn2,associated,gene,genotype" 
"AB  - Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in managing essential  hypertension, with considerable evidence available on their short-term efficacy  in lowering blood pressure (BP). However, there currently exists limited "pooled"  data examining the long-term efficacy of ARB treatment in controlling BP or  mitigating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The purpose of this study  was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the long-term  effects of ARBs as a class on BP control, myocardial infarction, hospitalization   for heart failure, cerebrovascular events (ie, stroke), cardiovascular mortality,  and all-cause mortality. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library  databases were searched from inception to March 2015. Two evaluators  independently reviewed studies for eligibility. Randomized controlled  hypertension trials were included if they reported on ARB efficacy in either BP  control (relative to placebo for periods >/= 6 months) or  cardiovascular/cerebrovascular outcomes (relative to non-ARB antihypertensive  therapies for periods >/= 24 months). Studies were pooled with a random-effects  model using weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks for continuous  and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. A total of 11 articles were included in  the narrative synthesis, representing seven unique trials (16,864 participants).   Six ARB agents were studied: candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan,  losartan (each represented by one trial arm), and telmisartan (represented by two  arms). ARB therapy significantly reduced mean systolic BP (WMD: -4.86; 95% CI:  -6.19, -3.53 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (WMD: -2.75; 95% CI: -3.65, -1.86 mm Hg]  compared to placebo. The risk of stroke was reduced by 21% in the ARB group  compared with alternative antihypertensives (risk ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66,  0.96). ARBs did not, however, produce statistically significant reductions in the  risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, or mortality. Our  findings suggest that ARBs, as a class, are more effective than placebo therapy  in long-term BP lowering in patients with essential hypertension. Long-term ARB  treatment may also confer enhanced protection against stroke but not other  cardiovascular outcomes relative to placebo."|"arb,bp,term,arbs,long"|"arb,bp,term,arbs,cardiovascular" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing epidemic of metabolic syndrome has been related to the  increased use of fructose by the food industry. In fact, the use of fructose as  an ingredient has increased in sweetened beverages, such as sodas and juices. We   thus hypothesized that fructose intake by hypertensive rats would have a worse  prognosis in developing metabolic disorder and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  METHODS: Male Wistar and SHR rats aged 6weeks were given water or fructose (10%)   for 6weeks. Blood glucose was measured every two weeks, and insulin and glucose  sensitivity tests were assessed at the end of the follow-up. Systolic blood  pressure was measure by plethysmography. Lean mass and abdominal fat mass were  collected and weighed. Liver tissue was analyzed to determine interstitial fat  deposition and fibrosis. RESULTS: Fasting glucose increased in animals that  underwent a high fructose intake, independent of blood pressure levels. Also,  insulin resistance was observed in normotensive and mostly in hypertensive rats  after fructose intake. Fructose intake caused a 2.5-fold increase in  triglycerides levels in both groups. Fructose intake did not change lean mass.  However, we found that fructose intake significantly increased abdominal fat mass  deposition in normotensive but not in hypertensive rats. Nevertheless, chronic  fructose intake only increased fat deposition and fibrosis in the liver in  hypertensive rats. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that, in normotensive and  hypertensive rats, fructose intake increased triglycerides and abdominal fat  deposition, and caused insulin resistance. However, hypertensive rats that  underwent fructose intake also developed interstitial fat deposition and fibrosis  in liver."|"fructose,intake,increased,rats,fat"|"fructose,intake,rats,fat,hypertensive" 
"AB  - With-no-lysine (K) Kinase-4 (WNK4) consisted of unique serine and threonine  protein kinases, genetically associated with an autosomal dominant form of  hypertension. Argumentative consequences have lately arisen on the association of  specific single nucleotide polymorphisms of WNK4 gene and essential hypertension   (EHT). The aim of this study was to determine the association of Ala589Ser  polymorphism of WNK4 gene with essential hypertensive patients in Malaysia. WNK4   gene polymorphism was specified utilizing mutagenically separated polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method  in 320 subjects including 163 cases and 157 controls. Close relation between  Ala589Ser polymorphism and elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP  and DBP) was recognized. Sociodemographic factors including body mass index  (BMI), age, the level of fasting blood sugar (FBS), low density lipoprotein  (LDL), and triglyceride (TG) in the cases and healthy subjects exhibited strong  differences (p < 0.05). The distribution of allele frequency and genotype of WNK4  gene Ala589Ser polymorphism showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between EHT  subjects with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and normotensive  subjects, statistically. The WNK4 gene variation influences significantly blood  pressure increase. Ala589Ser probably has effects on the enzymic activity leading  to enhanced predisposition to the disorder."|"wnk4,polymorphism,gene,ala589ser,blood"|"wnk4,gene,polymorphism,ala589ser,subjects" 
"AB  - In order to assess the left ventricular (LV) longitudinal rotation (LR) in  primary hypertension (PH) patients with a normal LV ejection fraction.  Conventional echocardiography was performed in 61 healthy subjects and 64 PH  patients. The apical four-chamber views in these patients were acquired by  GE-Vivid7 or E9, then the peak radial strain in the systolic period and the  strain rate in systole, in early and late diastolic periods, were measured.  Segmental LR and global LR were assessed by using two-dimensional speckle  tracking imaging (2D-STI). The peak radial strain rate in the early diastolic  period in PH patients was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects. The   rotational degrees of the middle and base lateral, the apex and the middle septum  walls in PH patients were significantly different from those of the healthy  subjects. The healthy subjects had prominent counter-clockwise LR (0.29 degrees  +/-2.86 degrees ) and the PH patients had prominent clockwise LR (-2.13 degrees  +/-2.93 degrees ) in non-LV wall hypertrophy and (-2.43 degrees +/-2.66 degrees )  in LV wall hypertrophy. The time delay between the LV lateral wall and the septum  wall in PH patients correlated to the peak LR. We concluded that 2D-STI can  assess the time delay between the LV lateral wall and the septum wall to the peak  LR and clockwise LR in patients with PH, and prove that PH patients have a  clockwise LR. By this, we conclude that in PH patients, the LV early systolic  function have changed."|"patients,ph,lr,lv,peak"|"patients,lr,ph,degrees,lv" 
"AB  - To estimate the relationship between type D personality and essential  hypertension among patients visiting their GPs for any health problem, 101  hypertensive and 138 nonhypertensive patients were consecutively recruited and  assessed using the Type D Personality Scale (DS14). The predictive value of type   D personality was determined using a logistic regression model, taking into  account the differences in recognized confounders between groups. Type D  personality in the hypertension group was twice as frequent as in the no  hypertension group and hypertension was more frequent among type D than non-type   D patients. Logistic regression showed a significant predictive value of type D  personality for hypertension, adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, family  history of hypertension, living condition, education, and employment. Therefore,   type D personality was strongly related to hypertension and it was a noteworthy  predictor of hypertension in a real-world cohort of primary care patients."|"hypertension,type,personality,patients,using"|"hypertension,type,personality,patients,frequent" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Serum cortisol level is elevated in patients with essential  hypertension. We aimed at investigating the association of serum cortisol levels   with parameters of renal function in essential hypertension. METHODS: One hundred  and seventy-eight patients with essential hypertension participated in the study.  Fasting serum samples were collected at 8:00 am. Renal function was measured as  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Chronic Kidney  Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine- cystatin C equation (eGFRcr-cys).   Correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis were used to detect the  relationship between cortisol and eGFRcr-cys. The distributions of serum cortisol  were split by the tertiles and subjects were stratified into those with low,  median and high levels accordingly. RESULTS: Serum cortisol levels were  significantly higher in subjects whose eGFRcr-cys<90 ml/min/1.73 m2 than subjects  whose eGFRcr-cys>90 ml/min/1.73 m2 (394.0+/-93.4 vs. 343.2+/-98.4 nmol/L,  P=0.001). Age, systolic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol, uric acid,  cortisol levels were significantly associated with eGFRcr-cys, serum levels of  creatinine and cystatin C. After adjusting for clinical factors, serum cortisol  level had a statistically significant negative association with the eGFRcr-cys  (beta=-0.19, P=0.027), and positive associations with cystatin C (beta=0.31,  P=0.001) and creatinine (beta=0.14, P=0.044). With the increment of cortisol  tertile, the eGFRcr-cys significantly decreased (93.18+/-14.36 vs. 84.61+/-14.67   vs. 81.29+/-12.36 ml/min/1.73 m2 for low, median and high tertile, respecively,  P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Serum cortisol level was negatively correlated with  eGFRcr-cys in subjects with essential hypertension. Further studies are needed to  investigate whether cortisol plays a role in hypertensive nephropathy  development."|"cortisol,serum,egfrcr,cys,levels"|"cortisol,serum,cys,egfrcr,levels" 
"AB  - AIM: To estimate the possibility of predicting the presence and severity of  coronary atherosclerosis from arterial stiffness characteristics and augmentation  index (AIx) in patients with essential hypertension (EH) obtained under  outpatient conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The general clinical examination of  15 patients aged 30-70 yr with EH was supplemented by measuring blood glucose and  creatinine levels, the lipid status (LWLP, HDLP, TG), duplex scanning of carotid   arteries, and evaluation of arterial stiffness by pulsed wave contour analysis.  RESULTS: AIx and age were independent risk factors of coronary atherosclerosis in  patients with EH and severity of its manifestations. AIx values over 25% were  with high specificity (over 85%) associated with atherosclerotic lesions."|"aix,patients,eh,arterial,stiffness"|"aix,eh,patients,arterial,atherosclerosis" 
"AB  - This study investigated left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction associated  with differential strain among myocardial layers in primary hypertension (PH)  patients with or without LV hypertrophy (LVH), and normal patients.In 63 PH and  42 healthy patients, two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography was used  to measure the peak systolic longitudinal and circumferential strain of the  myocardial subendocardial, middle and subepicardial layers, and the peak systolic  radial strain. To assess LV systolic function, the apical long axis, 4- and  2-chamber views, and parasternal short axis at the basal, middle, and apical  levels were acquired by cardiovascular ultrasound (Vivid E9, GE Healthcare,  USA).Overall, the pattern in peak systolic longitudinal strain among myocardial  layers was subendocardial > middle > subepicardial. In the peak systolic  circumferential strain, this was middle > subepicardial > subendocardial. The  peak systolic longitudinal strain was normal > NLVH > LVH. Among the groups, the   peak systolic circumferential strain at the basal parasternal short-axis level  was statistically similar, but at the middle and the apical parasternal  short-axis levels were NLVH > normal > LVH. In normal and NLVH patients, the peak  radial strain was middle > apical > basal, and in LVH patients was apical >  middle > basal. The peak averages of the longitudinal and subendocardial  circumferential strains differed significantly when LVH compared with NLVH and  normal patients.The systolic function of PH patients was damaged in comparison  with normal individuals, which could be detected conveniently and accurately  using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography."|"systolic,patients,strain,normal,apical"|"systolic,peak,strain,middle,patients" 
"AB  - Hypertension is the leading cause of death worldwide. Globally and locally there   has been an increase in hypertension in children, adolescents and young adults<40  years of age. In South Africa, the first decade of the millennium saw a doubling   of the prevalence rate among adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years. This   increase suggests that an explosion of cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular  disease and chronic kidney disease can be expected in the forthcoming decades. A   large part of the increased prevalence can be attributed to lifestyle factors  such as diet and physical inactivity, which lead to overweight and obesity. The  majority (>90%) of young patients will have essential or primary hypertension,  while only a minority (<10%) will have secondary hypertension. We do not  recommend an extensive workup for all newly diagnosed young hypertensives, as has  been the practice in the past. We propose a rational approach that comprises a  history to identify risk factors, an examination that establishes the presence of  target-organ damage and identifies clues suggesting secondary hypertension, and a  limited set of basic investigations. More specialised tests should be performed  only where there is a clinical suspicion that a secondary cause for hypertension   exists. There have been no randomised clinical trials on the treatment of  hypertension in young patients. Expert opinion advises an initial emphasis on  lifestyle modification. This can comprise a diet with reduced salt and refined  carbohydrate intake, an exercise programme and management of substance abuse  issues. Failure of lifestyle measures or the presence of target-organ damage  should prompt the clinician to initiate pharmacotherapy. We recommend referral to  a specialist practitioner in cases of resistant hypertension, where there is  severe target-organ damage and when a secondary cause is suspected."|"hypertension,young,lifestyle,secondary,organ"|"hypertension,young,secondary,cause,damage" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess predictive value of the cardiovascular prognosis by  comparing the two most used formulas for the estimation of glomerular filtration   rate in hypertensive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study  was designed that included 405 patients diagnosed with essential hypertension.  The patients were referred from Primary Care to the Hypertension and Vascular  Risk Unit between January 1, 1998 and August 31, 1999. Blood pressure  measurements, blood and urine analysis, and echocardiography were simultaneously   performed. They were followed up for 12.5 years (mean [+/- IQR]: 10.61 [+/- 3.11]  years) and 174 events were recorded. RESULTS: The study included 405 patients  (53.8% women), with a mean age of 55.5 years. The estimated glomerular filtration  rate according to the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations was 73.9+/-2.6 mL/min/1.73m(2)  and 76.9+/-2.2 mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively. The prevalence of chronic kidney  disease was 31.6% and 23.9%, respectively. Using the CKD-EPI equation led to the   re-classification of 22.9% of patients. The incidence rate ratio (IRR [95%CI] for  chronic kidney disease identified by the MDRD equation was 2.4 [1.8-3.3], and for  the CKD-EPI calculation it was 2.5 [1.8 to 3.3]). CONCLUSIONS: Both equations  estimate similar magnitudes of renal function, although the CKD-EPI equation has   less false positives, and both have similar prognostic values in patients at high  cardiovascular risk as well those at low risk."|"patients,epi,ckd,cardiovascular,rate"|"patients,ckd,epi,equation,rate" 
"AB  - One hundred and ninety-five children aged 8 to 13 years, of which 113 are  diagnosed with essential arterial hypertension (EAH), and 82 children from the  control group without somatic diseases including EAH were examined. All children   underwent dental examination. The values of the substrates and the primary  products of lipid peroxidation (LPO)--double bond (DB) and diene conjugates (DC)   were determined. The index of caries intensity exceeded the similar indicator in   comparison with the control group of children with EAH. The intensity of the  oxidation of substrates of LPO in patients with EAH compared with healthy  children was also higher. The article discusses the index of low value of DB in  patients with 1st stage of caries in combination with EAH, as a potential  negative factor limiting the generation of biologically active compounds in  systemic blood flow involved in the prevention of caries process."|"eah,children,caries,db,lpo"|"children,eah,caries,control,db" 
"AB  - AIM: To evaluate the antihypertensive efficiency and metabolic effects of  controlled monotherapy with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and indapamide retard (IR)   in hypertensive patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 50 patients  with Stage II essential hypertension, grades 1-3 blood pressure (BP) elevation,  who received 3-month monotherapy with IR (n=25) or HCT (n=25). Changes were  determined in BP, blood lipid, glucose, and potassium levels. The efficiency of  antihypertensive therapy was evaluated in the entire group and subgroups of  patients identified in accordance with the used diuretic and the presence (n=27)   or absence (n=23) of therapy at previous stages. RESULTS: A total of 54% of the  patients included in the study achieved target BP after 3 months of therapy. The   proportion of individuals with normalized BP was comparable in the HCT and IR  groups (52 and 56%, respectively) and in previously treated patients and those  who used for the first time antihypertensive drugs (51.8 and 56.5%,  respectively). Normalization of systolic and diastolic BPs was achieved in 78 and  58% of the patients, respectively. Target BP was achieved in 94,1%, 42,9% and  16,7% of patients with grades 1,2 and 3 hypertension, respectively. IR proved to   be metabolically neutral whereas HCT was found to significantly increase the  blood levels of triglycerides and glucose by 15.3% (p<0.05) and 12.2% (p<0.05),  respectively. CONCLUSION: Controlled diuretic monotherapy allows BP normalization  in more than 50% of the hypertensive patients. HCT and IR have similar  antihypertensive efficiency. Because of the negative changes observed in lipid  and carbohydrate metabolism with the use of relatively small doses of HCT, IR is   a preferential alternative in the long-term treatment of hypertensive patients."|"patients,hct,ir,bp,antihypertensive"|"patients,bp,hct,ir,respectively" 
"AB  - AIM: To investigate whether the functionally relevant -844G>A promotor  polymorphism in the catalase (CAT) gene is associated with the development of  essential hypertension (EH). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation enrolled  2,339 unrelated ethnic Russian people, including 1,269 EH patients and 770  apparently healthy individuals. Genotyping of CAT -844G>A (rs769214) polymorphism  was performed using a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS:   The -844A allele (odds ratio (OR)=1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04 to  1.64; small er, Cyrillic=0.02) and the -844AA genotype (OR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.02 to   1.94; small er, Cyrillic=0.03) were found to be related to a higher risk of EH in  the smokers. No association was found between this polymorphism and EH risk in  the non-smokers. CONCLUSION: Smoking is a predisposing factor for development of   EH in CAT -844AA genotype carriers."|"eh,cat,polymorphism,development,g"|"eh,cat,polymorphism,02,844aa" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the optimal cutoff of plasma aldosterone to rennin  concentration ratio (ARR) determined by an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay  for primary aldosteronism (PA) screening. METHODS: A total of 154 hypertensive  patients and 83 healthy volunteers were recruited in the study. Blood for  aldosterone and rennin were collected from patients in the supine position and  from patients and healthy volunteers after 2-hour upright posture. Plasma  aldosterone concentration(PAC) and plasma rennin concentration(PRC) were  determined with the automated chemiluminescent immunoassay. The diagnoses of PA  were made based on clinical manifestations, confirmatory tests and pathologic  results. A ROC curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal ARR cutoffs   for PA. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were diagnosed with PA, 85 were with  essential hypertension and 16 were with other types of endocrine hypertension. In  hypertensive patients, the areas under the ROC curves (AUCROC) of ARR were 0.962   (95%CI 0.933-0.990, P<0.01) in the supine position and 0.980 (95%CI 0.962-0.998,   P<0.01) after 2-hour upright posture, respectively. The AUCROC of ARR was higher   than that of either PAC or PRC in the same position. The highest Youden's index  of ARR in the upright posture was 0.85 with the cutoff value of 119.1 pmol/mU  [4.3 (ng/dl)/(mU/L)] (sensitivity 94%, specificity 91%). CONCLUSION: ARR in the  upright position by the automated chemiluminescent immunoassay provides a high  efficiency screening test for PA. The optimal cutoff of ARR is 119.1 pmol/mU."|"arr,pa,patients,position,upright"|"arr,pa,patients,position,upright" 
"AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha  (TNF-alpha) G308A gene polymorphism on essential hypertension (EHT) with or  without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The project was conducted on buccal  epithelial and blood cells for case and control patients, respectively.  Epithelial cells were obtained from the inner part of the cheeks. Techniques  including DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and restriction  fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were utilized to assess biomarkers of DNA  damage. Our results demonstrated significant differences between wild and mutated  genotypes among EHT patients without T2DM. We also found a significant  association between wild and mutated allele frequencies in EHT patients (P <  0.05). Clinical characteristics between the groups (EHT with or without T2DM and   controls) showed statistically significant association (P < 0.05). Overall, we  show that G308A polymorphism of the TNF-alphagene may be a significant genetic  risk factor for EHT without T2DM patients in Malaysia."|"eht,significant,without,t2dm,polymorphism"|"eht,patients,significant,t2dm,polymorphism" 
"AB  - NPRA and NPRC are candidate susceptibility genes for essential hypertension (EH)   and play a key role in the regulation of plasma levels and biological effects of   natriuretic peptides. The aims of the present study were to find new genetic  markers in the NPRA and NPRC genes and to assess relationships between variants  and EH. A total of 797 unrelated Mongolian herdsmen were enrolled, including 389   EH patients and 408 normotensive controls. Genotyping was performed using the  polymerase chain reaction/ligase detection reaction assay. The distribution of  the T-allele frequency of rs1847018 in NPRC differed significantly between  hypertensive subjects and controls. There was an association between rs1847018  and EH in the additive model in NPRC (P < 0.05). There were no significant  differences in the genotype and allele frequency distributions for any of the 3  single nucleotide polymorphisms in NPRA between EH and normotensive individuals.   In NPRA, the frequency of haplotype TCA in the EH group was significantly lower  than in controls, while the frequency of haplotype TCG was significantly higher  in the EH group than in controls; Individuals who possessed the TCA haplotype had  a significantly lower risk of EH, whereas the presence of haplotype TCG was  significantly associated with a higher risk of EH. However, there was no  significant difference between the EH group and controls in any of the 8  haplotypes in NPRC. Rs1847018 is a genetic marker of EH in NPRC, and the  frequency of haplotype TCA and TCG in NPRA is associated with EH in the Mongolian  population."|"eh,nprc,frequency,npra,controls"|"eh,nprc,controls,frequency,haplotype" 
"AB  - Genetic variants of the RGS5 gene are believed to be risk factors for  hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the  association between RGS5 gene variants and hypertension in the Mongolian and Han   populations. Peripheral blood was obtained from 429 unrelated Mongolian herdsmen   and 416 Han farmers [including essential hypertension (EH) patients and  controls]. Nine tagSNPs within the RGS5 genes were retrieved from HapMap, and the  samples were individually genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction/ligase  detection reaction assay. The distribution of the allele frequency of rs12035879   differed significantly between hypertensive subjects and controls in the Han  population, while the distribution of the allele and genotype frequencies of  rs16849802 differed significantly between hypertensive subjects and controls in  the Mongolian population. We observed an association between rs16849802 and EH in  the Mongolian population. The frequency of haplotype GAA was significantly higher  in the EH group than in controls in the Mongolian population. However, the EH  group and controls did not differ significantly in all 6 haplotypes in the Han  population. The rs16849802 and haplotype GAA independently increased the risk of   EH in Mongolian patients, and may be used as a risk factor for the prediction of   high blood pressure."|"mongolian,eh,han,controls,risk"|"mongolian,controls,eh,population,han" 
"AB  - This study investigated the STK39 expression in peripheral blood of hypertension   patients and the relation between its genetic polymorphism and blood pressure.  The observation group comprised of 42 primary hypertension patients admitted to  our hospital, and the control group comprised of 30 healthy individuals who  underwent physical examination in our hospital during the same period. Fasting  venous blood was collected from both groups in the morning to determine the STK39  mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood using quantitative real-time PCR and   western blot. STK39 gene SNP (rs6433027) was sequenced using PCR and its genetic   variation was analyzed. The relationship between STK39 protein level, genetic  variation, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure was also analyzed. The  observation group showed increased STK39 mRNA and protein levels in peripheral  blood compared to the control group, and the difference was statistically  significant (P < 0.05), suggesting C/T mutation in STK39 gene SNP (rs6433027).  Correlation analysis showed positive association between STK39 protein level and   diastolic and systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05), indicating a positive  association between C/T genetic mutation and diastolic and systolic blood  pressure (P < 0.05). In conclusion, STK39 mRNA and protein express abnormally in   primary hypertension patients with genetic variation, which is related to the  blood pressure."|"stk39,blood,protein,genetic,group"|"blood,stk39,genetic,pressure,protein" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiac autonomic modulation and baroreflex sensitivity are altered  in individuals with essential hypertension. Hypertension is considered as a  strong and independent risk factor for supraventricular and ventricular  arrhythmias. The aim of the present study was to evaluate cardiac autonomic  control and the arrhythmogenic risk by using 24-h heart rate variability (HRV)  and heart rate turbulence (HRT) analysis in essential hypertension without left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). METHODS: Fifty-eight newly diagnosed untreated  hypertensive patients without LVH (mean age 51 +/- 12 years, 26 women) and 56  adult, healthy volunteers (mean age 49 +/- 12 years, 24 women) were included in  the study. Subjects with secondary causes of hypertension or autonomic  dysfunction were excluded. The diagnosis of hypertension was based on ambulatory   blood pressure monitoring results. Time-domain HRV parameters and HRT parameters   were calculated from 24-hour Holter recordings. RESULTS: Values of SDNN and SDANN  in the hypertension group were significantly lower than in the control group (P <  0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). At least one of the turbulence onset (TO) and  turbulence slope (TS) values were found abnormal in 10 of 32 hypertensive  patients and in 5 of 24 control individuals (P = 0.38). There was no significant   difference between HRT parameters, TO and TS (P = 0.67 and P = 0.12,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic tone begins to increase in hypertension  before LVH develops. However, the impact of this increase on HRT is not clear.  There is a need for further research to investigate the impact of hypertension  and LVH on HRT."|"hypertension,hrt,lvh,autonomic,turbulence"|"hypertension,hrt,24,lvh,12" 
"AB  - We conducted a case-control study to determine the contribution of polymorphisms   in CYP2C8 (CYP2C8*3) and CYP2J2 (CYP2J2*7) to increased risk of coronary artery  disease and essential hypertension in Bulgarians. The current analysis included  192 unrelated hypertensive patients, 261 patients with angiographically  documented CAD (153 with myocardial infarction and 108 without myocardial  infarction), and 496 population controls. The CYP2C8*3 and CYP2J2*7 polymorphisms  were genotyped by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. PLINK version 1.07 was used for  the statistical analysis. No overall association was observed for the studied  polymorphisms with coronary artery disease and essential hypertension. The  frequency of -50T mutant allele of CYP2J2*7 was significantly higher in male with  coronary artery disease without history of myocardial infarction (OR 2.16 95% CI   1.04-4.48 p = 0.035) compared to population control group, but this association  did not survive after Bonferroni correction (p adj = 0.07). A significant  association of CYP2C8*3 allele with increased risk of essential hypertension has   found in men (OR 2.12 95% CI 1.18-3.81 p = 0.015) and this relationship remained   significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (p adj = 0.03). This is the  first study showing significant gene-sex interaction for CYP2C8*3 with twofold  increase in the relative risk of essential hypertension and a similar tendency  for CYP2J2*7 associated with coronary artery disease without myocardial  infarction in Bulgarian males. The association is not seen in females and in the   whole group of patients. This result could be partly explained by the effect of  estrogens on the vascular tone of coronary arteries and CYP2C8 gene expression."|"cyp2c8,coronary,association,cyp2j2,hypertension"|"cyp2c8,coronary,cyp2j2,artery,association" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of gingival overgrowth during visiting care.  BACKGROUND: Ca-channel blocker-induced gingival overgrowth is a well-known  adverse event. However, only limited information on the treatment of  calcium-channel blocker-induced gingival overgrowth during visiting care has been  reported. CLINICAL REPORT: The patient was an 88-year-old female living in a  nursing home since dementia. She had been taking a calcium-channel blocker and  observed gingival overgrowth. Initial therapy was performed and changed the  antihypertensive medication from a calcium-channel blocker to an angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitor. After initial therapy, the gingival overgrowth  improved significantly. In addition, the defecation rate was improved.  CONCLUSION: This case indicated that periodontal therapy is useful even for  dementia patients during visiting dental care."|"overgrowth,gingival,channel,therapy,blocker"|"gingival,overgrowth,blocker,channel,calcium" 
"AB  - Experimental and clinical evidence obtained in the last 2 decades clearly  indicates that protracted exposure to inappropriately elevated aldosterone levels  causes significant changes in left ventricular structure and function. Animal  studies have demonstrated that aldosterone induces myocardial inflammatory  changes and fibrosis in the presence of a high salt diet. Moreover, the effects  of aldosterone on the heart have been investigated in different clinical  conditions. These conditions include systolic and diastolic heart failure,  essential hypertension, and primary aldosteronism that offers a unique clinical  model to study the cardiac effects of excess aldosterone because these effects  are isolated from those of the renin-angiotensin axis. A relatively clear picture  is emerging from these studies with regard to aldosterone-related changes in left  ventricular mass and geometry. Conversely, no direct effect of aldosterone on  left ventricular diastolic function can be demonstrated and improvement of  diastolic function obtained in some studies that have employed mineralocorticoid   receptor blockers could result from left ventricular mass reduction. Animal  experiments demonstrate that effects of aldosterone on the left ventricle require  high salt intake to occur, but the evidence of this contribution of salt to  aldosterone-induced cardiac changes in humans remains weaker and needs further  research. The article reviews the results of clinical studies addressing the role  of aldosterone in regulation of LV remodeling and diastolic function, and focuses  on the possible relevance of salt intake."|"aldosterone,left,studies,clinical,changes"|"aldosterone,left,changes,clinical,diastolic" 
"AB  - Nitroglycerine-induced vasodilation (NID) is usually measured as a control test  for flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). However, NID per se is also associated with  atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships  among NID, FMD and blood pressure, and to evaluate the effects of  antihypertensive therapy on NID in patients with hypertension. We measured NID  and FMD simultaneously in 94 subjects, including 35 normotensive subjects, 26  patients with stage 1 hypertension (140/90 mm Hg) and 33 patients with stage 2  hypertension (160/100 mm Hg), and we evaluated the effect of antihypertensive  therapy for 4 weeks on vascular function in 14 patients with hypertension. NID  was smaller in patients with stage 2 hypertension than in patients with stage 1  hypertension and normotensive subjects (10.5+/-3.9% vs. 13.8+/-5.0% and  16.2+/-5.7%; P<0.05, respectively), whereas there was no significant difference  in NID between normotensive subjects and patients with stage 1 hypertension. FMD   was smaller in patients with stage 2 and stage 1 hypertension than in  normotensive subjects (3.1+/-2.7% and 4.1+/-1.5% vs. 6.4+/-2.7%; P<0.05,  respectively), whereas there was no significant difference in FMD between  patients with stage 1 hypertension and those with stage 2 hypertension. After 4  weeks of antihypertensive therapy, NID was enhanced from 11.9+/-3.4% to  14.0+/-3.7% (P=0.03) in patients with hypertension. There was a significant  relationship between the decrease in diastolic blood pressure and the increase in  NID (r=-0.35, P=0.04). Both NID and FMD were impaired in patients with stage 2  hypertension. Four-week antihypertensive therapy improved NID in patients with  hypertension."|"nid,fmd,hypertension,patients,antihypertensive"|"hypertension,patients,nid,stage,fmd" 
"AB  - Autonomic failure (AF) is characterized by orthostatic hypotension, supine  hypertension, and increased blood pressure (BP) variability. AF patients develop   cardiac organ damage, similarly to essential hypertension (EH), and have higher  arterial stiffness than healthy controls. Determinants of cardiovascular organ  damage in AF are not well known: both BP variability and mean BP values may be  involved. The aim of the study was to evaluate cardiac organ damage, arterial  stiffness, and central hemodynamics in AF, compared with EH subjects with similar  24-hour BP and a group of healthy controls, and to evaluate determinants of  target organ damage in patients with AF. Twenty-seven patients with primary AF  were studied (mean age, 65.7+/-11.2 years) using transthoracic echocardiography,   carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, central hemodynamics, and 24-hour ambulatory  BP monitoring. They were compared with 27 EH subjects matched for age, sex, and  24-hour mean BP and with 27 healthy controls. AF and EH had similar left  ventricular mass (101.6+/-33.3 versus 97.7+/-28.1 g/m(2), P=0.59) and  carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (9.3+/-1.8 versus 9.2+/-3.0 m/s, P=0.93);  both parameters were significantly lower in healthy controls (P<0.01). Compared  with EH, AF patients had higher augmentation index (31.0+/-7.6% versus  26.1+/-9.2%, P=0.04) and central BP values. Nighttime systolic BP and 24-hour  systolic BP predicted organ damage, independent of BP variability. AF patients  develop hypertensive heart disease and increased arterial stiffness, similar to  EH with comparable mean BP values. Twenty-four-hour and nighttime systolic BP  were determinants of cardiovascular damage, independent of BP variability."|"af,bp,eh,organ,damage"|"bp,af,damage,eh,hour" 
"AB  - Previous genome-wide association studies identified serine threonine kinase 39  (STK39), encoding STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase, as one of a  limited number of hypertension susceptibility genes. A recent meta-analysis  confirmed the association of STK39 intronic polymorphism rs3754777 with essential  hypertension, among previously reported hypertension-associated STK39  polymorphisms. However, the biochemical function of this polymorphism in the  mechanism responsible for hypertension is yet to be clarified. We generated  rs3754777G>A knockin human cell lines with clustered regularly interspaced short   palindromic repeats-mediated genome engineering. Homozygous (A/A) and  heterozygous (G/A) knockin human embryonic kidney cell lines were generated using  a double nickase, single-guide RNAs targeting STK39 intron 5 around  single-nucleotide polymorphism, and a 100-bp donor single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotide. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with sequencing   analyses revealed the identical STK39 transcripts among the wild-type and both  knockin cell lines. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction   showed increased STK39 mRNA expression, and immunoblot analysis revealed  increases in total and phosphorylated STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich  kinase with increased phosphorylated Na-K-Cl cotransporter isoform 1 in both  knockin cell lines. The largest increases in these molecules were observed in the  homozygous cell line. These findings indicated that this intronic polymorphism  increases STK39 transcription, leading to activation of the STE20/SPS1-related  proline/alanine-rich kinase-solute carrier family 12A signaling cascade.  Increased interactions between STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase and  the target cation-chloride cotransporters may be responsible for hypertension  susceptibility in individuals with this polymorphism."|"stk39,hypertension,cell,polymorphism,kinase"|"stk39,cell,hypertension,kinase,polymorphism" 
"AB  - Serum uric acid (UA) is independently associated with hypertension and blood  pressure (BP) variability (BPV) is associated with cardiovascular events and  mortality in hypertensive patients. The aim of the present study was to assess  the association of serum UA with BPV in 300 untreated essential hypertension  patients (mean age 57.3+/-13.6 years). BPV was quantified as the standard  deviation (SD) of the 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime mean values obtained by  using ambulatory BP monitoring. In correlation analysis, log UA values were found  to be positively correlated with 24-hour systolic BPV and nighttime systolic and   diastolic BPV (Pearson coefficients of 0.246, 0.280, and 0.353, respectively;  P<.001 for all). In multivariate analysis, log UA had an independent association   with 24-hour systolic BPV and nighttime systolic and diastolic BPV. This study  show for the first time that increased serum UA is independently associated with   BPV in untreated essential hypertension patients."|"bpv,ua,associated,hour,values"|"bpv,ua,systolic,24,associated" 
"AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of 3  types of antihypertensive drug regimens between different salt intake levels. The  180 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension participating in this  randomized, controlled clinical trial were randomly allocated to a low-salt diet   (LSD) group or a non-low-salt diet (NLSD) group. Each group included 3 subgroups:  a losartan 100 mg subgroup, a losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg  subgroup, and an irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg subgroup. The LSD group received   a diet in which the sodium content was strictly controlled (2.3 g/day). After 2  months, the office blood pressure (BP), the 24-hour mean BP, and the morning BP  were significantly reduced (P </= .01) in each group. No significant differences   were observed between the 3 LSD subgroups (P > .05). In the NLSD group, the  losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg subgroup, and the irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg  subgroup exhibited identical antihypertensive efficacy (P > .05), and these  groups were significantly different from the losartan 100 mg subgroup(P </= .05).  The BP of the patients who received the LSD was further decreased compared with  those who received the NLSD (P </= .05). Therefore, we concluded that this LSD  exerts synergistic BP-reducing effects."|"lsd,bp,group,mg,antihypertensive"|"mg,group,subgroup,bp,lsd" 
"AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the main causes of vision loss,   especially in the elderly. The involvement of essential hypertension in its  pathogenesis has been well covered in the literature since it was first  recognized. Hemodynamic abnormalities appear to contribute to AMD, with the  renin-angiotensin system playing a significant role. Many studies have  demonstrated that high blood pressure is associated with lower choroidal blood  flow and disturbed vascular homeostasis in these patients. In addition, AMD is  characterized by abnormal neovascularization, to which angiotensin II and growth   factors make a large contribution. Most epidemiological studies have found  essential hypertension to be a risk factor for AMD. However, although all agree  that the strongest predisposing factors are age and smoking, overall there is  some inconsistency regarding the exact role of hypertension in its pathogenesis.   In particular, there are no data in the literature to support the view that  antihypertensive medication and the successful management of hypertension have a   positive effect on the clinical outcome of AMD. This reinforces the data  indicating that the cause of AMD is multifactorial and suggests that, although  essential hypertension probably plays a role, in itself it is unlikely to be a  major contributor to the future occurrence of AMD.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: In hypertension, changes in small arterial structure are  characterized by an increased wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR). These adaptive processes  are modulated by the rennin-angiotensin system. It is unclear whether direct  renin inhibitors exert protective effects on small arteries in hypertensive  patients. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study  (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01318395), 114 patients with primary  hypertension were randomized to additional therapy with either placebo or  aliskiren 300 mg for 8 weeks after 4 weeks of standardized open-label treatment  with valsartan 320 mg (run-in phase). Parameter of arteriolar remodelling was WLR  of retinal arterioles (80 - 140 mum) assessed noninvasively and in vivo by  scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany). In addition,   pulse wave analysis (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Australia) and pulse pressure  (PP) amplification were determined. RESULTS: In the whole study population, no  clear effect of additional therapy with aliskiren on vascular parameters was  documented. When analyses were restricted to patients with vascular remodelling,   defined by a median of WLR more than 0.3326 (n = 57), WLR was reduced after 8  weeks by the treatment with aliskiren compared with placebo (-0.044 +/- 0.07  versus 0.0043 +/- 0.07, P = 0.015). Consistently, after 8 weeks of on-top  treatment with aliskiren, there was an improvement of PP amplification compared  with placebo (0.025 +/- 0.07 versus -0.034 +/- 0.08, P = 0.013), indicative of  less stiff arteries in the peripheral circulation. CONCLUSION: Thus, our data  indicate that treatment with aliskiren, given on top of valsartan therapy,  improves altered vascular remodelling in hypertensive patients."|"aliskiren,wlr,treatment,patients,placebo"|"aliskiren,patients,placebo,treatment,weeks" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: As larger numbers of hypertensive patients are screened for primary  aldosteronism with the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), automated analyzers  present a practical solution for many laboratories. We report the method-specific  ARR cutoff determined with direct, automated chemiluminescence immunoassays  allowing the simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone concentrations (PACs)  and plasma renin concentrations (PRCs). METHODS: Method comparisons to commonly  employed assays and tandem mass spectrometry were undertaken. Patients were  previously diagnosed based on the local ARR cutoff of 1.2 (ng/dl)/(muIU/ml) in  samples collected in upright seated position. Lack of aldosterone suppression in   response to salt load to less than 5 ng/dl confirmed primary aldosteronism. For  the new assays, the optimal ARR cutoff was established in 152 patients with  essential hypertension, 93 with primary aldosteronism and 147 normotensive  patients. Aldosterone suppression was assessed in 73 essential hypertensive and  46 primary aldosteronism patients. RESULTS: PAC and PRC were significantly  correlated to values determined with currently available methods (P < 0.001). In   patients with primary aldosteronism, patients with essential hypertension and  controls, mean (95% confidence interval) PAC was 28.4 (25.4-31.8), 6.4 (5.9-6.9)   and 6.2 (5.6-6.9) ng/dl, respectively. In the same groups, PRC was 6.6 (5.6-7.7),  12.9 (11.2-14.8) and 26.5 (22.2-31.5) muIU/ml. An ARR cutoff of 1.12 provided  98.9% sensitivity and 78.9% specificity. Employing the new assay aldosterone  suppression confirmed the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and essential  hypertension using the cutoff of 5 ng/dl. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that  the new assays present a convenient alternative for the measurement of PAC and  PRC on a single automated analyzer. Availability of these simultaneous assays  should facilitate screening and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.  bMedizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Ludwig Maximilians  Universitaet, Munich cEndokrinologikum Berlin, Friedrichstr, Berlin, Germany  dDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of British  Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada eCentro di Fisiologia Clinica e  Ipertensione, Universita di Milano, Ospedale Policlinico,Via Francesco Sforza,"|"patients,aldosteronism,aldosterone,assays,arr"|"aldosteronism,patients,primary,aldosterone,arr" 
"AB  - OBJECT: In spite of solid anatomical and physiological arguments and the  promising results of Jannetta in the 1970s, treating essential hypertension by  microvascular decompression (MVD) of the brainstem has not gained acceptance as a  mainstream technique. The main reason has been a lack of established selection  criteria. Because of this, the authors' attempts have been limited to patients  referred for MVD for hemifacial spasm (HFS) who also had hypertension likely to  be related to neurovascular compression (NVC). METHODS: Of 201 patients referred   for HFS, 48 (23.8%) had associated hypertension. All had high-resolution MR  images that demonstrated NVC. All underwent MVD of the root exit/entry zone (REZ)  of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves (CN IX-X) and adjacent ventrolateral  medulla in addition to the CN VII REZ. Effects on hypertension, graded using the   WHO classification, were studied up to the latest follow-up, which was 2-16 years  from the time of surgery, 7 years on average. Also, effects of MVD on blood  pressure (BP) according to the side of vascular compression were evaluated.  RESULTS: Preoperatively, hypertension was severe in all but 1 of the patients; in  spite of medical treatment, 47 patients still had WHO Grade 1 or 2 hypertension,   and 18 still had unstable BP. After MVD, at latest follow-up, BP had returned to   normal (i.e., systolic pressure < 140 mm Hg) in 28 patients; 14 of these patients  (29.10% of the whole series) were able to maintain normal BP without any  antihypertensive treatment; the other 14 still required some medication to  maintain their BP below 140 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). Also, at latest follow-up, BP  remained unstable in only 8 of the 18 patients with instability prior to MVD (p <  0.02). Analysis according to side of compression showed that of the 30 patients  with left-sided compression, 17 had their BP normalized (without medication in 11  cases), and of the 18 patients with right-sided compression, 11 had their BP  normalized (without medication in 3 cases). The difference between sides was not   significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results argue for considering MVD for the  treatment of hypertension likely to be due to NVC at the CN IX-X REZ and adjacent  ventrolateral medulla. Criteria for selecting patients with hypertension alone  still need to be established and could include the following indications:  apparently essential hypertension, likely to be neurogenic, in patients in whom  high-resolution MRI shows clear-cut images of NVC at the CN IX-X REZ and adjacent  ventrolateral medulla and in whom BP cannot be controlled by medical treatment."|"hypertension,patients,mvd,bp,nvc"|"patients,bp,hypertension,mvd,compression" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is a serious risk factor affecting up to 30% of the  world's population with a heritability of more than 30-50%. The aim of this study  was to investigate the contribution of the polymorphisms localized in the  angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, a main component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system, in inducing the susceptibility to essential hypertension (EH) among  isolated populations (Yi and Hani minorities) with low prevalence rate from the  remote region of Yunnan in China. METHODS: A case-control association study was  performed, and all subjects were genotyped for the seven single nucleotide  polymorphisms localized in the AGT region by polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Three  polymorphisms, i.e. rs5046, rs5049, and rs2478544, were significantly associated   with EH among the Hani minority. The associations, found in the Yi minority, did   not reach a conclusive level of statistical significance. The polymorphisms of  rs2478544 and rs5046 caused the transformations of exonic splicing enhancer sites  and transcription factor binding sites, respectively, in the bioinformatic  analyses. The haplotype-rs5046T, rs5049A, rs11568020G, rs3789679C, rs2478544C was  susceptible for EH among the Hani minority. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested  that the AGT polymorphisms have played a vital role in determining an  individual's susceptibility to EH among the isolated population, which would be  helpful for EH management in the remote mountainous region of Yunnan in China."|"polymorphisms,eh,among,agt,region"|"eh,polymorphisms,agt,hani,minority" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been considered to play an  important role in the regulation of blood pressure. This study aimed to  investigate the correlation between RAS gene polymorphisms and essential  hypertension (EH) in the Chinese Yi ethnic group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total   of 244 EH subjects and 185 normotensive individuals from the Chinese Yi ethnic  group were genotyped for AGT M235T (rs699), AT1R A1166C (rs5186), ACE I/D  (rs4340) and ACE G2350A (rs4343) polymorphisms by the polymerase chain reaction  (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. RESULTS:  Significant differences in the allele and genotype frequency of ACE G2350A were  observed between the EH cases and controls (p=0.001, 0.002). After being grouped   by gender, significant differences in the allele and genotype frequency of ACE  G2350A and AT1R A1166C were observed between females of the EH cases and controls  (ACE G2350A: p=0.000, 0.002; AT1R A1166C: p=0.008, 0.011). After excluding the  influence of multifactorial interactions, the ACE G2350A polymorphism is  significantly associated with the pathogenesis of EH in the Chinese Yi ethnic  group (odds ratio (OR)=1.656, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.807-2.524, p=0.019).  CONCLUSIONS: The RAS-related ACE G2350A polymorphism is associated with the  pathogenesis of EH in the Chinese Yi ethnic group."|"ace,g2350a,eh,ras,polymorphism"|"ace,eh,g2350a,chinese,ethnic" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have evaluated the associations between the  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene polymorphisms and essential  hypertension (EH) risk. However, the results remain uncertain. We carried out a  meta-analysis to derive a more comprehensive estimation of these associations.  METHODS: Case-control studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE,  Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wangfang databases. Odds  ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength  of the associations. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between the  ACE2 G8790A polymorphism and EH risk in males (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.44; p =   0.0004; I(2) = 34%) and females (OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.34; p = 0.0003; I(2) =  31%), respectively. Significant associations were also observed between the ACE2   rs2106809 polymorphism and EH risk in males (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.39; p =  0.0004; I(2) = 18%) and females (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27-1.51; p < 0.00001; I(2)   = 0%), respectively. However, there was no significant association between the  ACE2 A1075G polymorphism and EH risk in males (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.77-2.10; p =   0.35; I(2) = 69%) and females (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83-1.26; p = 0.84; I(2) =  33%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ACE2 G8790A and  rs2106809 polymorphisms may be associated with EH risk."|"associations,ace2,eh,results,risk"|"95,ci,ace2,associations,eh" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several studies show that the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism  of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with  hypertension in various populations. The present study sought to determine the  association of the I/D gene polymorphism among Malay male essential hypertensive   subjects in response to ACE inhibitors (enalapril and lisinopril). MATERIALS AND   METHODS: A total of 72 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and 72 healthy   subjects were recruited in this study. Blood pressure was recorded from 0 to 24  weeks of treatment with enalapril or lisinopril. Genotyping of the I/D  polymorphism was carried out using a standard PCR method. RESULTS: Statistically   significant association of the D allele of the ACE gene was observed between the   case and control subjects (p < 0.01). There was a decrease in blood pressure in  the patients carrying the DD genotype (SBP=18.5+/-8.1 mmHg, DBP=15.29+/-7.1 mmHg)  rather than the ID (SBP=4.1+/-3.3 mmHg, DBP=9.1+/-3.5 mmHg) and II genotypes  (SBP= 3.0+/-0.2 mmHg, DBP 0.11+/-6.1 mmHg) of the ACE gene. CONCLUSION: Patients   carrying the DD genotype had higher blood pressure-lowering response when treated  with ACE inhibitors enalapril or lisinopril than those carrying ID and II  genotypes, suggesting that the D allele may be a possible genetic marker for  essential hypertension among Malay male subjects."|"ace,gene,polymorphism,subjects,hypertension"|"mmhg,ace,gene,subjects,blood" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) G894T gene polymorphism   is associated with the risk of primary hypertension (PH) and vascular  complications in adults with PH. METHODS: We explored the associations of the  G894T polymorphism with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, left ventricular mass  (LVM), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), urinary albumin excretion,  oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters in 126 children with newly diagnosed  PH and in 83 healthy children. RESULTS: Among the 126 children with PH 92 (73%)  had ambulatory hypertension and 34 (27%) had severe ambulatory hypertension. Left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was detected in 39 (31%) patients, cIMT of >2  standard deviation scores in 21 (16.6%) patients, albuminuria of >30 mg/24 h in  18 (14.3%) patients and metabolic syndrome (MS) in 22 (17.5%) patients. The  frequency of the T allele was 52.4% in the PH group and 54.2% in the control  group (not significant), and in both groups the frequency of the T allele was  consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with G allele carriers,   hypertensive T allele carriers had increased cIMT (p < 0.05) and more severe  albuminuria (not significant, p = 0.1); there was no difference between the  groups in hypertension severity and LVM. T and G allele distribution did not  differ between patients with and without metabolic syndrome. No significant  correlations between the assessed parameters and the eNOS G894T gene polymorphism  were found in the controls, although T allele carriers tended to have an  increased cIMT (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: The eNOS T allele is not more prevalent  among hypertensive children than among healthy ones, but it is associated with  early vascular damage in children with PH, independent of metabolic  abnormalities. No associations between the eNOS G894T polymorphism and metabolic   abnormalities were found."|"allele,ph,cimt,enos,children"|"allele,ph,children,patients,cimt" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDdf) and arterial stiffness  are associated with increased mortality in patients with arterial hypertension.  THE AIM: of the study was to evaluate the relation between left ventricular  diastolic function and hemodynamic profile assessed by impedance cardiography  (ICG). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 209 hypertensives clinical evaluation,  echocardiography and ICG were performed to evaluate i.e. septal annulus early  diastolic velocity (e'), mitral flow ratio (E/A), stroke index (SI), acceleration  index (ACI), velocity index (VI), Heather index (HI), total arterial compliance.   RESULTS: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was associated with lower SI  (p=0.049), VI (p=0.002), ACI (p=0.014), HI (p=0.002) and higher SVRI (p=0.004).  There were no significant differences in age, blood pressure, BMI, sex  distribution. Males with LVDdf characterized with lower SI (p=0.011), VI  (p<0.00001), ACI (p=0.0005), HI (p=0.00005) and higher SVRI (p=0.008). No such  relevant differences were observed in women. In the analysis of the relations  between clinical/hemodynamic features and echocardiographic indices of left  ventricular diastolic function the significant correlations were observed in  males, the most relevant for: age vs E/A (-0.45; p<0.001), VI vs e' (0.30;  p<0.001), VI vs E/A (0.30; p<0.001), and SVRI vs e' (-0.28; p<0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Impedance cardiography revealed to be useful in the evaluation of  impaired left ventricular performance and increased arterial stiffness related to  LVDdf in young and middle-aged hypertensives. Sex may influence cardiovascular  hemodynamics resulting in slightly different ventricular-vascular interactions  that should be considered in therapeutic strategies."|"ventricular,diastolic,left,arterial,lvddf"|"ventricular,diastolic,left,vi,001" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between electroencephalogram and perceived  stress in Chinese essential hypertension (EH) patients. METHODS: Totally 60 EH  patients were enrolled as the case group,and 60 gender-and age-matched healthy  subjects as the control group. Graded mental arithmetic was used as a  psychological stressor. The physiological values of electroencephalogram  (Theta,Alpha,sensorimotor rhythm,and Beta) were recorded at baseline and in  mission period and recovery period. Subjects were instructed to complete the  Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: The electroencephalogram Theta value was  significantly different between the case group and the control group  (t=4.01,P=0.048). In the case group,the fluctuating Theta value was correlated  with the control dimension in the Perceived Stress Scale (r=-0.26,P=0.044). Also   in the case group,with the score of "sense of control" as the dependent variable   and the fluctuating value of Theta after stress as the independent  variables,regression analysis was performed. The opt-in standard was</=0.05 and  the culling standard was>/=0.01. The Results shows that the fluctuating value of   Theta after stress in the case group met the requirements to enter the equation  and could explain 5.2% of "sense of control" dimension. CONCLUSION: The Theta  values associated with the sleeping and creativity decrease under stressful  situations in EH patients following the increaed sense of pressure due to failure  in controlling the pressure events."|"stress,theta,group,control,sense"|"group,theta,case,control,stress" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of metformin on left ventricular remodeling in   patients with primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to  investigate the effects of hypertension duration and duration of drug  administration on metformin's cardiac action. METHODS: The clinical and  echocardiographic data of 176 patients with primary hypertension and type 2  diabetes mellitus who were admitted to department of cardiology from January to  December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The follow-up period was 6 to 24  months (the median follow-up time was 11 months). The patients were classified  into two groups according to the usage of metformin: metformin group (n=84) and  control group (n=92). The clinical data and echocardiography findings were  evaluated both at baseline and follow-up. Subgroup analyses were used to assess  the effects of hypertension duration and duration of drug medication on  metfomin's action. RESULTS: At baseline, there was no significant difference in  interventricular septum depth (IVSD), left ventricular posterior wall depth  (LVPWD), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) between the two groups. At the  follow-up period, IVSD (P=0.001), LVPWD (P=0.04) and LVMI (P=0.01) were lower in   metformin group. Multiple linear regression indicated that metformin had  significant influence on LVPWD (P=0.02) and LVMI (P=0.04). At the follow-up  period, LVMI was lower in two metformin subgroups. Additionally, LVMI was lower  in the group which the patients took metformin for more than one year than that  in control group (P=0.04). For patients whose hypertension duration was not  shorter than 5 years, IVSD (P=0.01) and LVMI (P=0.02) were lower in metformin  group at the follow-up period, compared with control group. CONCLUSIONS:  Metformin may attenuate hypertrophy of left ventricular in patients with primary   hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In patients with longer hypertension  duration and longer duration of metformin use, metformin may show more obvious  effects."|"metformin,patients,hypertension,group,follow"|"metformin,duration,group,hypertension,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common cardiovascular disease  worldwide, and it has a strong genetic component. Cortisol homeostasis is an  important factor in controlling blood pressure, and the availability of this  hormone is regulated by 11betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme  (11betaHSD1), which converts cortisone into cortisol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  investigated the correlation between EH and the single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) ins4436A located on the hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 1 gene among  the Polish population. The study included a total of 268 patients with confirmed   EH and 151 unrelated controls. All studied polymorphisms were detected using the   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. RESULTS: The carriage of   ins4436A (rs45487298) polymorphism in intron 3 of the HSD11B1 gene was more  frequent among patients with EH than among controls (p=0.013). The analysis of  association of ins4436A with the risk of EH indicated an odds ratio (OR) of 2.44   (95% confidential interval: 1.24-4.82). Moreover, essential hypertension occurred  less frequently in males than in females. Results of multivariate analysis in the  study group showed that ins4436A is a strong predictor of diabetes mellitus type   2 and ins4436A may lead to a decrease of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL)  cholesterol level. DISCUSSION: The cause of essential hypertension has not been  fully established, but genetic factors seem to play a very important role. In our  study we found that ins4436A in the HSD11B1 gene was associated with essential  hypertension in a Polish population. Nevertheless, the impact of ins4436A in the   HSD11B1 gene on the occurrence of essential hypertension requires further  investigations."|"ins4436a,eh,hypertension,essential,gene"|"ins4436a,eh,essential,hypertension,gene" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between behavioural factors and the risk of  chronic conditions and 2-week prevalence. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional  survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in Zhongshan, China. PARTICIPANTS: A  multistage clustering sampling method was used to select a representative sample   of residents from the household registration system between July and September  2011. The overall sample replacement rate was 9.4%, and the final sample included  43 028 individuals. OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic conditions and 2-week prevalence.  RESULTS: 4979 (11.6%) of the participants reported having at least one chronic  condition, 1067 (2.5%) had two or more concurrent chronic conditions, and 6830  (15.9%) reported having at least one disease in a 2-week recall period. The most   common chronic condition was primary hypertension, which was reported by 6.8% of   participants. Logistic regression models demonstrated that the main factors for  having a chronic condition and 2-week prevalence were older age (>/=65 years of  age; OR 44.91, 95% CI 33.05 to 61.03; and OR 12.71, 95% CI 10.44 to 15.46,  respectively), obesity (OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.63 to 3.42; and OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.22 to  2.82, respectively) and being a former smoker (OR 3.02, 95% CI 2.54 to 3.58; and   OR 3.24, 95% CI 2.74 to 3.82, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests  that older age, obesity and unhealthy behaviours are high-risk factors for poorer  health status among the residents of Zhongshan, China. The present findings  highlight the importance of recognising and managing harmful behaviours in order   to improve health."|"chronic,factors,week,sample,participants"|"95,chronic,ci,week,age" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major cause of worldwide  morbidity and mortality. Nutrition plays an important role in the primary,  secondary, and tertiary prevention of CVDs. The present longitudinal study used  the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) to investigate changes in dietary  behavior in coronary patients (CPs) affected by acute coronary syndrome and  hypertensive patients (HPs) affected by essential arterial hypertension. METHODS:  CPs (N = 250) and HPs (N = 246) completed a questionnaire during three  measurement points (baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up).  Statistical analyses included a repeated measures ANOVA and a multi-sample  structural equation model. RESULTS: HPs showed no changes in dietary behavior,  whereas CPs improved their nutrition at 6 months and then maintained the  healthier diet. The multi-sample analysis indicated equivalence of the HAPA model  for both patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further  evidence for the generalisability of the HAPA model, shedding light on dietary  behavior among CVD patients and particularly on hypertensive patients which has  received little attention. Moreover, the equivalence of the model suggests that  the process of change is almost identical for individuals who are at high risk  for a coronary event (i.e. HPs) and individuals who have already had the event  (i.e. CPs)."|"model,hps,hapa,cps,patients"|"cps,hps,model,patients,behavior" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: This review aims to clarify the relationship between telomeres and  essential hypertension. DESIGN AND METHODS: A PubMed search and a critical review  were performed relating to studies about the clinical and biological relevance of  telomeres in essential hypertension. RESULTS: Telomeres and telomerase activity  play an important role in the occurrence and development of hypertension in both   animal and human studies. CONCLUSIONS: A more complete understanding of the  molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension could reduce the   incidence of hypertension-related diseases."|"hypertension,telomeres,development,studies,review"|"hypertension,telomeres,development,essential,review" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a  fimasartan/amlodipine combination in patients with hypertension and to determine   the optimal composition for a future single-pill combination formulation.  METHODS: This Phase II study was conducted by using a randomized, multicenter,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 x 3 factorial design. After a 2-week placebo   run-in period, eligible hypertensive patients (with a sitting diastolic blood  pressure [SiDBP] between 90 and 114 mm Hg) were randomized to treatment. They  received single or combined administration of fimasartan at 3 doses (0, 30, and  60 mg) and amlodipine at 3 doses (0, 5, and 10 mg) for 8 weeks. The primary  efficacy end point was the change in SiDBP from baseline and at week 8; secondary  end points included the change in SiDBP from baseline and at week 4 and the  changes in sitting systolic blood pressure from baseline and at weeks 4 and 8.  Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. FINDINGS: 420 Korean   patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated to the 9  groups. Mean (SD) SiDBP changes in each group after 8 weeks were as follows:  placebo, -6.0 (8.5) mm Hg; amlodipine 5 mg, -10.6 (9.2) mm Hg; amlodipine 10 mg,   -15.9 (7.2) mm Hg; fimasartan 30 mg, -10.1 (9.1) mm Hg; fimasartan 60 mg, -13.0  (10.0) mm Hg; fimasartan 30 mg/amlodipine 5 mg, -16.2 (8.5) mm Hg; fimasartan 30   mg/amlodipine 10 mg, -19.5 (7.5) mm Hg; fimasartan 60 mg/amlodipine 5 mg, -16.6  (6.9) mm Hg; and fimasartan 60 mg/amlodipine 10 mg, -21.5 (8.3) mm Hg. All  treatment groups produced significantly greater reductions in blood pressure  compared with the placebo group. In addition, all combination treatment groups  had superior reductions in blood pressure compared with the monotherapy groups.  In the combination treatment groups, doubling fimasartan dose in the given dose  of amlodipine did not show further BP reduction, whereas doubling amlodipine dose  showed significantly further BP reduction in the given dose of fimasartan. During  the study period, 75 (17.9%) of 419 patients experienced 110 AEs. Ninety-five AEs  were mild, 9 were moderate, and 6 were severe in intensity. Eight patients  discontinued the study due to AEs. There was no significant difference in  incidence of AEs among groups (P = 0.0884). The most common AE was headache (12  patients [2.9%]), followed by dizziness (11 patients [2.6%]) and elevated blood  creatine phosphokinase levels (6 patients [1.4%]). IMPLICATIONS: Fimasartan  combined with amlodipine produced superior blood pressure reductions and low  levels of AEs compared with either monotherapy. Therefore, a single-pill  combination with fimasartan 60 mg/amlodipine 10 mg will be developed.

"AB  - The endothelium is recognized as a major determinant of vascular physiology and  pathophysiology. Over the last few decades, a plethora of studies have implicated  endothelial dysfunction in the progression of atherosclerosis and the subclinical  target organ damage observed in essential hypertension. However, the clinical  significance of diagnosing endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential  hypertension remains under investigation. Although a number of vascular and  non-vascular markers of endothelial dysfunction have been proposed, there is an  ongoing quest for a marker in the clinical setting that is optimal, inexpensive,   and reproducible. In addition, endothelial dysfunction emerges as a promising  therapeutic target of agents that are readily available in clinical practice. In   this context, a better understanding of its role in essential hypertension  becomes of great importance. Here, we aim to investigate the clinical  significance of endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension by accumulating  novel data on (a) early diagnosis using robust markers with prognostic value in  cardiovascular risk prediction, (b) the association of endothelial dysfunction  with subclinical vascular organ damage, and (c) potential therapeutic targets."|"endothelial,dysfunction,clinical,essential,vascular"|"dysfunction,endothelial,clinical,essential,hypertension" 
"AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a common polymorphism  -463G>A (rs2333227) in the promoter of myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene, an oxidant  enzyme producing hypohalogenic radicals, is associated with the risk of essential  hypertension (EH) in Russian population. A total of 2044 unrelated subjects  including 1256 EH patients and 788 normotensive controls were recruited for this   study. Genotyping of the MPO gene polymorphism was done using TaqMan-based assay.  A genotype -463GA was associated with decreased risk of EH (odds ratio = 0.82;  95% confidence interval: 0.68-1.00) at a borderline significance level (P = .05).  The gender-stratified analysis showed that a carriage of the -463GA and -463AA  genotypes is associated with decreased EH risk only in females (odds ratio =  0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.96; P = .02). To the best of our knowledge,  this is the first study reporting a negative association between the -463G>A  polymorphism of the MPO gene and EH risk. Molecular mechanisms by which MPO gene   is involved in the pathogenesis of EH are discussed."|"eh,gene,mpo,risk,study"|"eh,gene,mpo,risk,associated" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) results when the balance between vasoconstriction and  vasodilation is shifted in favor of vasoconstriction. This balance is controlled   by the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors. When there is an unstable  balance, vitamin D deficiency as an epigenetic factor triggers a shift to the  side of vasoconstriction. In this article, we critically analyze clinical  findings on the effect of vitamin D on blood pressure, combined with progress in   molecular mechanisms. We find that vitamin D repletion exerts a clinically  significant antihypertensive effect in vitamin D-deficient EH patients. Of note,   a few trials reported no antihypertensive effect from vitamin D due to suboptimal  study design. Short-term vitamin D supplementation has no effect on blood  pressure in normotensive subjects. This could explain the mixed results and may  provide a theoretical basis for future trials to identify beneficial effects of  vitamin D in intervention for EH."|"vitamin,effect,balance,vasoconstriction,eh"|"vitamin,effect,balance,eh,vasoconstriction" 
"AB  - The aim of the study was to estimate and correlate circulating levels of  renalase, vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), catecholamines in patients with  primary hypertension. The renalase, VAP-1, and catecholamines concentration was  estimated in 121 hypertensive patients. The correlation between renalase, VAP-1  levels and catecholamine concentration in blood, blood pressure control,  pharmacological therapy, and medical history were taken in to consideration. The   median office blood pressure was 145.5/86 mm Hg and was significantly higher than  the median home blood pressure measurement value, which was 135/80 mm Hg, P <  .05. Circulating renalase and VAP-1 (Me 9.57 mug/mL and Me = 326.7 ng/mL) levels   were significantly higher in patients with hypertension comparing to healthy  individuals (3.83 mug/mL and 248.37 ng/mL, P < .05). The correlation between  renalase and noradrenalin concentration in blood was observed (r = 0.549; P <  .05), also the correlation between VAP-1 and noradrenaline was noticed (r = 0.21,  P = .029). Renalase level was higher in patients with coronary artery disease and  correlated with decreased ejection fraction. VAP-1 concentration correlated also   with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.23, P = .013). Hypertensive  patients with diabetes mellitus had almost statistically significant higher VAP-1  concentration compared with hypertensive patients without diabetes mellitus (Me =  403.22 ng/mL vs. Me = 326,68 ng/mL, P = .064). In multiple regression analysis,  renalase was predicted by plasma dopamine and norepinephrine as also diastolic  office blood pressure and left ventricle ejection fraction. Circulating renalase   and VAP-1 levels are elevated in patients with poor blood pressure control. Its  correlation with noradrenalin concentration need further studies to find out the   role of renalase as also VAP-1 in pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension."|"renalase,vap,patients,blood,concentration"|"renalase,vap,blood,patients,concentration" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with hypertension, psychosocial factors, such as  depressive symptoms and anxiety, are associated with reduced quality of life and   triple the risk of nonadherence with medical treatment regimens. Thus, screening   tests are crucial to identify patients who may require further assessment and  treatment. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current study was to test the  psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms  Questionnaire-Short Form (MASQ-SF-C) in patients with essential hypertension.  METHODS: The MASQ-SF-C, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale  (CES-D), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered to a  convenience sample of 869 hypertensive patients in 4 hospitals. A confirmatory  factor analysis was used to test the tripartite model. We evaluate the internal  consistency of the MASQ-SF-C and we used the Bland-Altman approach to evaluate  convergent validity between the MASQ-SF-C t score and symptoms of (1) depressive   symptoms and (2) anxiety. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the total  MASQ-SF-C was .95, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the 3 subscales were .83  for anhedonic depression (AD), .91 for anxiety arousal (AA), and .94 for general   distress (GD), indicating adequate internal consistency reliability. The mean  interitem correlation coefficients were as follows: MASQ-SF-C, 0.29; AD, 0.28;  AA, 0.38; and GD, 0.40. The 1-month test-retest reliability for the MASQ-SF-C was  0.72. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the 3 first-order factors (GD,   AD, and AA) fit the data well (nonnormed fit index = 0.953, comparative fit index  = 0.936, incremental fit index = 0.936, root-mean-square error of approximation =  0.038). CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the reliability and validity of the  MASQ-SF-C, indicating that it can be used for assessing depressive symptoms and  anxiety concurrently in Chinese-speaking patients with hypertension."|"masq,sf,anxiety,patients,symptoms"|"masq,sf,anxiety,patients,symptoms" 
"AB  - Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of monogenic hypertension, has been  regarded as a rare disorder, which leads to many Liddle syndrome patients being  misdiagnosed and experiencing severe complications at an early age. Little is  known about the prevalence of Liddle syndrome. In this study, the authors  investigated the prevalence of Liddle syndrome confirmed by genetic testing among  young hypertension patients of undetermined causes in China. A total of 330  hypertensive patients aged 14 to 40 years after exclusion of common secondary  causes of hypertension were enrolled and serum potassium concentrations were  measured. Patients with hypokalemia underwent genetic testing of the 13th exon of  genes encoding beta and gamma subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).  Diagnosis was established by identification of mutations that destroy the PY  motif of ENaC. Five patients were diagnosed with Liddle syndrome (prevalence,  1.52%), as well as 12 of their relatives. These patients with Liddle syndrome  presented with an earlier onset of hypertension, a stronger family history of  hypertension, and higher blood pressure than those with essential hypertension.  All patients had hypokalemia and suppressed plasma renin activity. The results  demonstrated that Liddle syndrome is an important etiology of hypertension in  this young population. Screening of Liddle syndrome should focus on young  hypertension patients, particularly those with early penetrance, hypokalemia, and  low renin levels after exclusion of common secondary causes."|"hypertension,patients,syndrome,liddle,hypokalemia"|"hypertension,liddle,patients,syndrome,causes" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) influencing blood pressure (BP) response to the beta-blocker atenolol.  METHODS: Genome-wide association analysis of BP response to atenolol monotherapy   was performed in 233 white participants with uncomplicated hypertension in the  pharmacogenomic evaluation of antihypertensive responses study. Forty-two  polymorphisms with P less than 10 for association with either diastolic or  systolic response to atenolol monotherapy were validated in four independent  groups of hypertensive individuals (total n = 2114). RESULTS: In whites, two  polymorphisms near the gene PTPRD (rs12346562 and rs1104514) were associated with  DBP response to atenolol (P = 3.2 x 10 and P = 5.9 x 10, respectively) with  directionally opposite association for response to hydrochlorothiazide in another  group of 228 whites (P = 0.0018 and P = 0.00012). A different polymorphism  (rs10739150) near PTPRD was associated with response to atenolol in 150 black  hypertensive individuals (P = 8.25 x 10). rs12346562 had a similar trend in  association with response to bisoprolol (a different beta-blocker) in 207 Finnish  men in the genetics of drug responsiveness in essential hypertension study. In  addition, an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs4742610) in the PTPRD  gene was associated with resistant hypertension in whites and Hispanics in the  international verapamil SR trandolapril study (meta-analysis P = 3.2 x 10).  CONCLUSION: PTPRD was identified as a novel locus potentially associated with BP   response to atenolol and resistant hypertension in multiple ethnic groups."|"response,atenolol,hypertension,association,study"|"response,atenolol,10,associated,association" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to assess the effects of polymorphisms in genes  associated with essential hypertension on the variation of erythrocyte membrane  proteins (EMPs) in hypertensive patients. METHODS: Major EMPs content was  analyzed in blood from 1162 unrelated Russians (235 hypertensive patients, 176  healthy controls, and 751 random individuals from the Central Russia population).  Essential hypertension patients were genotyped for 11 polymorphisms of essential   hypertension susceptibility genes including ADD1 (rs4961), GNB3 (rs5443,  rs16932941), NOS3 (rs1799983, rs2070744), ACE (rs5186), AGTR1 (rs5186), AGT  (rs699, rs4762), MR (rs5534), and TGFB1 (rs1800471). EMP contents and their  relationship with the genetic loci were analyzed using various statistical tests.  RESULTS: Sex-specific differences in EMP contents between the cases and controls   were observed. Regardless of sex, hypertensives exhibited mainly decreased levels  of alpha (SPTA1) and beta-spectrin (SPTB) and increased levels of glucose  transporter (GLUT1) as compared with healthy subjects (P </= 0.001). EMP  correlated differently in essential hypertension patients and controls. Almost  70% of the joint variation in the EMP levels is explained by five gender-specific  principal components. The essential hypertension susceptibility genes showed  considerable effects on the levels of spectrins and glucose transporter. A joint   variation of the genes explained about half the total polygenic variance in the  GLUT1, SPTA1, and SPTB levels in hypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed  that essential hypertension susceptibility genes are the important factors of the  inherited EMP variation, and their pleitropic effects may be mirrored in the  altered expression of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and those related to  intracellular glucose metabolism."|"emp,genes,hypertension,levels,essential"|"essential,genes,hypertension,emp,levels" 
"AB  - The regulation of metabolism in vivo can be comprehended by considering stages of  becoming inphylogenesis of humoral, hormonal, vegetative regulators separately:  at the level of cells; in paracrin-regulated cenosises of cells; organs and  systems under open blood circulation and closed system of blood flow.

Only this way need  of cells in functional, structural interaction and forming of multicellular  developed. The development of organs and systems of organs also completed at the   level of "relative biological perfection". From the same level the third stage of  becoming of regulation of metabolism at the level of organism started.

"AB  - Hypertension is the major risk factor for stroke, and genetic factors contribute   to its development. Inflammation has been hypothesized to be the key link between  blood pressure elevation and stroke. We performed an analysis of the association   between inflammatory mediator gene polymorphisms and the incidence of stroke in  patients with essential hypertension (EH). The study group consisted of 625  individuals (296 patients with noncomplicated EH, 71 hypertensive patients with  ischemic stroke, and 258 control subjects). Both patients and controls were  ethnic Tatars originating from the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russian  Federation). The analysis has shown that the risk of ischemic stroke was  associated with the CXCR2 rs1126579 polymorphism. Our results indicate that among  patients with EH, the heterozygous genotype carriers had a higher risk of stroke   (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.01-2.92), whereas the CXCR2*C/C genotype was protective  against stroke (OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.83). As shown by the gene-gene  interaction analysis, the CXCR2 rs1126579 polymorphism was also present in all  genotype/allele combinations associated with the risk of stroke. Genetic patterns  associated with stroke also included polymorphisms in the CCL2, CCL18, CX3CR1,  CCR5, and CXCL8 (IL8) genes, although no association between these loci and  stroke was detected by individual analysis."|"stroke,patients,analysis,risk,eh"|"stroke,patients,analysis,risk,associated" 
"AB  - The A-20C polymorphism in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene has been associated with  increased risk of essential hypertension in several studies; however, these  studies gave inconsistent results. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to  assess the association between AGT A-20C polymorphism and essential hypertension.  Published literature was retrieved from PubMed. Pooled odd's ratio (OR) with 95%   confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effect models. A  total of 10 case-control studies containing 3653 cases and 3457 controls were  enrolled to this meta-analysis. In a combined analysis, the results showed a  significant association between the AGT A-20C polymorphism and risk of essential   hypertension (AA vs CC: OR = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.46-0.84; recessive model: OR = 0.66,  95%CI = 0.49-0.88). In the subgroup analysis stratified by race, significant  associations were found between the AGT A-20C polymorphism and essential  hypertension risk in Asians (AA vs CC: OR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.43-0.80; recessive  model: OR = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.46-0.85). In conclusion, the results of this  meta-analysis suggested that the AGT A-20C polymorphism was associated with risk   of essential hypertension in Asians."|"analysis,ci,agt,results,essential"|"20c,95,agt,analysis,ci" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic hypertension (HTN) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may  be associated with left atrial (LA) dilation, but whether LA functional  abnormalities are characteristic to each disease or not, is unknown. The aim of  this study was to characterize LA mechanical changes in patients with HTN and HCM  using vector velocity imaging (VVI). METHODS: VVI-derived longitudinal LA  function was acquired from apical views in 76 CM patients, 33 hypertension  patients and 30 age-matched controls. Peak atrial longitudinal strain  (varepsilonsys ), atrial strain rate during systole (SRsys ), early diastole (SRe  ), and late diastole (SRa ) were measured (corresponding to LA reservoir, conduit  and contractile functions, respectively). Similar parameters were used to assess   left ventricular (LV) function. RESULTS: LV mass and LA volume index were higher   in HCM and HTN than in controls. Both LA Reservoir function (LA varepsilonsys  SRsys ) and conduit function (SRe ) were more declined in HCM patients, in  comparison to HTN patients and controls (P < 0.0001),whereas conduit function was  the only function deteriorated in the HTN group. LA contractile function was  preserved among patient groups. In HCM, LV varepsilonsys and SRa [P < 0.001] are   independent predictors for LA varepsilonsys . While in hypertension, only LVMI is  an independent predictor for LA dysfunction (P < 0.01). By receiver operating  characteristic analyses, only atrial reservoir function was extrapolative and  appeared to be accurate in discriminating HCM from both hypertension and  controls, with LA varepsilonsys </= 33% being more sensitive (71.8%) and specific  (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Response of LA mechanics to pathologic hypertrophy is  entirely different. In HCM LA reservoir and conduit functions are more  deteriorated and related to the severity of phenotype, while in hypertension the   conduit function is chiefly affected and LA dysfunction is linked to a more  advanced disease."|"la,function,hcm,hypertension,htn"|"la,function,hcm,conduit,htn" 
"AB  - High-dose calcium channel blocker (CCB) shows strong blood pressure (BP) lowering  effect. Currently available of controlled-release (CR) nifedipine 80 mg per day  clinical data are limited to monotherapy and short-term or long-term  retrospective studies. We report the safety and efficacy results of a 52-week,  prospective open-label study, in which Japanese patients with essential  hypertension were treated with CR nifedipine [80 mg per day; 40 mg bis in die  (BID; twice daily)] in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. The  patients with inadequate BP control despite treatment with CR nifedipine (40 mg  once daily) in combination with other antihypertensive drugs were enrolled. The  primary objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of CR  nifedipine (80 mg per day). Efficacy variables included changes in the mean  sitting BP, the target BP achievement rate and the BP response rate. CR  nifedipine (80 mg per day) was generally well tolerated, with the most common  drug-related treatment-emergent adverse event being tachycardia (6.9% of  patients). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in three  (4.2%) patients. By week 52, the mean reductions in sitting systolic and  diastolic BP were 19.4 and 13.6 mm Hg, respectively. The target BP achievement  and BP response rates after 52 weeks of treatment were 32.4 and 63.4%,  respectively. Based on these findings, long-term treatment with CR nifedipine at   40 mg BID in combination with antihypertensive drugs was well tolerated and  effective in Japanese patients with essential hypertension."|"bp,patients,treatment,cr,mg"|"bp,mg,cr,nifedipine,patients"

We assessed the expression levels of the microRNAs miR-1, miR-133a,  miR-26b, miR-208b, miR-499, and miR-21, in 102 patients with essential  hypertension and 30 healthy individuals. All patients underwent two-dimensional  echocardiography. MicroRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells were quantified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction. Hypertensive patients showed significantly lower miR-133a (5.06 +/-  0.50 vs. 13.20 +/- 2.15, P < .001) and miR-26b (6.76 +/- 0.53 vs. 9.36 +/- 1.40,   P = .037) and higher miR-1 (25.99 +/- 3.07 vs. 12.28 +/- 2.06, P = .019),  miR-208b (22.29 +/- 2.96 vs. 8.73 +/- 1.59, P = .016), miR-499 (10.06 +/- 1.05  vs. 5.70 +/- 0.91, P = .033), and miR-21 (2.75 +/- 0.15 vs. 1.82 +/- 0.20, P =  .002) expression levels compared with healthy controls. In hypertensive patients,  we observed significant negative correlations of miR-1 (r = -0.374, P < .001) and  miR-133a (r = -0.431, P < .001) and significant positive correlations of miR-26b   (r = 0.302, P = .002), miR-208b (r = 0.426, P < .001), miR-499 (r = 0.433, P <  .001) and miR-21 (r = 0.498, P < .001) expression levels with left ventricular  mass index. Our data reveal that miR-1, miR-133a, miR-26b, miR-208b, miR-499, and  miR-21 show distinct expression profiles in hypertensive patients relative to  healthy individuals and they are associated with clinical indices of left  ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Thus, they may be related to  heart hypertrophy in hypertensive patients and are possibly candidate therapeutic  targets in hypertensive heart disease."|"patients,hypertensive,mir,expression,hypertrophy"|"mir,patients,001,hypertensive,vs" 
"AB  - Prefrontal (PFC) cerebral vasoreactivity may be altered in hypertension but has  not been studied during postural change and carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing. In   this study, a dual procedure of 5% CO2 rebreathing with positional change  (standing to supine and reverse) was performed on normotensive (N = 24) and  essential hypertensive males (N = 16) (18-55 years) to assess reliability of PFC   responses using functional near infrared spectroscopy. The groups (matched on age  levels, N = 13) were also compared on their hemodynamic reactivity (change of  oxyhemoglobin or total hemoglobin as a function of change in end tidal CO2).  Test-retest reliability within one session and 7 days later was moderate to high   (intraclass correlation coefficient = .63-.901) in both normotensive and  hypertensive groups for all hemodynamic measures; whereas reliability of  reactivity measures for oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin was moderate  (intraclass correlation coefficient = .68-.762). Functional near infrared  spectroscopy-measured PFC hemodynamic responses are highly reproducible in  normotensive and adult essential hypertensive males."|"change,reliability,pfc,co2,hemodynamic"|"change,co2,hemodynamic,hypertensive,normotensive" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to compare ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring  (ABPM) data and determine which hypertension type is a risk factor in target  organ damage. A total of 82 children (47 boys) with suspected hypertension based   on office BP measurements and considered hypertensive by ABPM were studied.  Target organ damage included the following: 35.3% hypertensive retinopathy, 25.6%  microalbuminuria, 15.8% increased left ventricular mass index, 29.2% increased  carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), 24.3% high augmentation index (AIx), and  19.5% high pulse wave velocity (PWV). The association between BP load, PWV, and  cIMT was statistically significant. There were significant correlations between  daytime systolic BP load, PWV, AIx, and cIMT. A statistically significant  difference was also detected between nighttime systolic BP load, PWV, and cIMT  values and nighttime diastolic BP load levels and values of AIx and cIMT. There  was also a statistically significant difference between the high level of  nighttime diastolic BP load and cIMT. The authors found that target organ damage   was seen more often in children with primary hypertension who had systolic loads."|"bp,cimt,hypertension,load,target"|"bp,cimt,load,pwv,significant" 
"AB  - The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in hypertensive patients ranges  from 3 to 26%. Drugs are a common cause of non-neurogenic OH. In the present  study, we retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 9242 patients with  essential hypertension referred to our Hypertension Unit. We analysed data on  supine and standing blood pressure values, age, sex, severity of hypertension and  therapeutic associations of drugs, commonly used in the treatment of  hypertension. OH was present in 957 patients (10.4%). Drug combinations including  alpha-blockers, centrally acting drugs, non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel  blockers and diuretics were associated with OH. These pharmacological  associations must be administered with caution, especially in hypertensive  patients at high risk of OH (elderly or with severe and uncontrolled  hypertension). Angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) seems to be not related with OH  and may have a potential protective effect on the development of OH."|"oh,hypertension,patients,drugs,associations"|"oh,hypertension,patients,drugs,associations" 
"AB  - The major epigenetic features of mammalian cells include DNA methylation,  posttranslational histone modifications and RNA-based mechanisms including those   controlled by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs (miRNAs)). An important aspect of   epigenetic mechanisms is that they are potentially reversible and may be  influenced by nutritional-environmental factors and through gene-environment  interactions. Studies on epigenetic modulations could help us understand the  mechanisms involved in essential hypertension and further prevent it's progress.   This review is focused on new knowledge on the role of epigenetics, from DNA  methylation to miRNAs, in essential hypertension."|"mechanisms,epigenetic,dna,methylation,mirnas"|"epigenetic,mechanisms,dna,essential,hypertension" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, and confers a high   risk of stroke and heart failure. Hypertension and ageing are two important risk   factors of incident atrial fibrillation and are both associated with increased  arterial stiffness. The possible relationship between arterial stiffness and  atrial fibrillation is insufficiently documented and is probably complex. We  tested these relations in a cohort of hypertensive patients. METHODS: The  population belongs to a registry which includes patients referred before  administration of antihypertensive treatment and fulfilling the following  criteria: office blood pressure (BP) above 140/90 mmHg, essential hypertension,  no history of cardiovascular events, type 1 diabetes or atrial fibrillation, 24-h  ambulatory measurement of BP coupled with the measurement of timing of Korotkoff   sounds to assess arterial stiffness [indexed theoretical value of QKD interval  for a SBP of 100 mmHg, at heart rate (HR) of 60 b.p.m., indexed for height and  QRS duration (QKDh)]. An echocardiographic examination was carried out at  baseline in the majority of patients. Atrial fibrillation-free survival was  analysed with a Cox model including sex, diabetes, smoking,  hypercholesterolaemia, QKDh, average 24-h pulse pressure and mean BP, mean 24-h  HR, BMI and left atrial diameter (LAD), when available. RESULTS: We included 853   patients and recorded 67 new onsets of atrial fibrillation (mean follow-up = 102   +/- 62 months). Analysis found three variables significantly and independently  linked to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation: age, QKDh and 24-h average HR.  When LAD was introduced (n = 480, 35 incident atrial fibrillation), three  variables were linked to incident atrial fibrillation: age, QKDh and LAD.  CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness is a strong predictor of future atrial  fibrillation in hypertensive patients, independently of age, 24-h pulse pressure   and LAD."|"atrial,fibrillation,patients,qkdh,stiffness"|"atrial,fibrillation,24,patients,arterial" 
"AB  - Hypertension is a multifactorial disease caused by environmental, metabolic and  genetic factors, but little is currently known on the complex interplay between  these factors and blood pressure. The aim of the present study was to assess the   potential impact of obesity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D  polymorphism and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3) 4a/4b, G894T and  -T786C variants on the essential hypertension. The study group consisted of 1,027  Caucasian adults of Polish nationality (45.5 +/- 13.6 years old), of which 401  met the criteria for hypertension. Body weight, height and blood pressure were  measured and data on self-reported smoking status were collected. Fasting blood  glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides were   determined by standard procedures. The ACE I/D polymorphism and three  polymorphisms in NOS3 gene (4a/4b, G894T, -T786C) were detected by the PCR  method. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that age above 45 years,  diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and male sex are important risk factors for  hypertension and no significant influence of variants in ACE and NOS3 genes on  this risk was recognized. Obese subjects had a 3.27-times higher risk (OR = 3.27,  95% CI: 2.37 - 4.52) of hypertension than non-obese, and in obese the NOS3 894T  allele was associated with 1.37 fold higher risk of hypertension (P = 0.031). The  distribution of NOS3 G894T genotypes supported the co-dominant (OR = 1.35, P =  0.034, Pfit = 0.435) or recessive (OR = 2.00, P = 0.046, Pfit = 0.286), but not  dominant model of inheritance (P = 0.100). The study indicates that in obese NOS3  G894T polymorphism may enhance hypertension risk. However, in the presence of  such strong risk factors as age, diabetes and smoking, the impact of this genetic  variant seems to be attenuated. Further studies are needed to reveal the  usefulness of G894T polymorphism in hypertension risk assessment in obese."|"hypertension,risk,nos3,g894t,factors"|"hypertension,risk,nos3,g894t,obese" 
"AB  - The study involved 23 men after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with comorbid  arterial hypertension (AH). Mean age of patients was 56.7 years. Recurrent  myocardial infarction was determined in 38.4%, cardiac failure I-III functional  classes--100% of the cases. All patients underwent clinical examination,  electrocardiography and echocardiography, blood lipid profile. Standard  comprehensive treatment for two years included an perindopril 5-10 mg/day,  beta-blocker bisoprolol--5-10 mg/day, antisclerotic drug atorvastatin--20 mg/day   and aspirin--75 mg/day. The patients after treatment was determined by a gradual   increase towards the target of AT at 3, 6 and 12 to 24 months. Concentric left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) before treatment was determined in 47.8%,  eccentric--in 52.2% of patients. In the study of degrees of LVH I (initial) the  extent to treatment was determined by 4.3%, II (moderate)--26.1%, III (large)--at  69.6%, indicating the development of cardiac remodeling. After the treatment was   determined by marked reduction III (large) degree and transfer it in the II  (moderate) and I (small) degree of left ventricular hypertrophy due to more or  less pronounced changes remodeling left ventricular. The obtained data allow a  more detailed and adequately assess the structural and functional outcome  variables and determine the regression of myocardial hypertrophy in the  background to achieve target blood pressure, which is important in practical  cardiology."|"treatment,determined,patients,myocardial,hypertrophy"|"determined,treatment,day,mg,patients"

"AB  - Adropin is a recently identified bioactive protein that promotes energy  homeostasis by affecting glucose and lipid metabolism. Recently, adropin has also  been reported to be associated with endothelial dysfunction. Also, ET-1, as a  biomarker for endothelial dysfunction, is a key regulator in hypertension.  Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to detect the relationship between   plasma adropin and ET-1 levels in hypertension. A total of 123 participants,  diagnosed with primary hypertension on the basis of World Health Organization  criteria (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >/= 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood  pressure (DBP) >/= 90 mmHg), and 58 normotensive subjects were enrolled in the  cross-sectional study from October 2011 to December 2013. All study participants   were older than 18 years of age. Adropin and ET-1 levels were measured by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that plasma adropin levels  were significantly lower in hypertensives compared with controls (3.18 +/- 1.00  vs 4.21 +/- 1.14 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Plasma ET-1 levels were higher in  hypertensives than controls (2.60 +/- 1.14 vs 1.54 +/- 0.66 pg/mL, P < 0.001).  Adropin had a negative correlation with DBP (r = -0.40, P < 0.001), SBP (r =  -0.49, P < 0.001), and adjusted for age, body mass index, SBP, DBP, glucose, TC,   TG, LDL, and Cr, there was a negative correlation between ET-1 and adropin (r =  -0.20, P = 0.04). In multivariate logistic regression analysis of the variables,   ET-1 (odds ratio [OR], 3.84; 95% CI, 2.16-6.81; P < 0.001) and adropin (OR, 0.99;  95% CI, 0.99 -1.0; P < .001) were found to be independent predictors for  hypertension.In conclusion, decreased plasma adropin levels are associated with  increased blood pressure in hypertension. Adropin is an independent predictor for  hypertension, and may influence blood pressure by protecting endothelial  function."|"adropin,et,hypertension,levels,plasma"|"adropin,001,et,hypertension,levels" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been reported to be  beneficial on some components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). We tested the  hypothesis that in hypertensive patients, presence of MetS and its related  components is associated with cell membrane content of PUFA, a measure that  reflects the dietary intake of these fatty acids. METHODS: In 55 consecutive  patients with primary hypertension referred to our university center, we measured  anthropometric variables, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, general  biochemistries including plasma lipids, and the fatty acid composition of red  blood cell (RBC) membrane by gas chromatography. RESULTS: The prevalence of the  MetS was 36.4% and in hypertensive patients with MetS, the RBC membrane content  of total PUFA, PUFA of the n-6 family (n-6 PUFA), PUFA of the n-3 family (n-3  PUFA), polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio (PUFA/SFA), and omega-3  index was significantly lower than in patients without MetS. RBC membrane total  PUFA, n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA, PUFA/SFA ratio, and omega-3 index were significantly  and directly correlated with high-desity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, a   correlation that did not differ across tertiles of plasma apolipoprotein-A1. In  multivariate linear regression analysis, HDL-cholesterol resulted to be directly   and independently related to RBC membrane n-6 PUFA, PUFA/SFA ratio, and omega-3  index. Conversely, total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio had inverse and  independent relationship with n-6 PUFA, PUFA/SFA ratio, and omega-3 index.  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hypertension the MetS is associated with lower cell  membrane content of PUFA that is explained by a direct and independent  relationship of membrane PUFA with HDL-cholesterol. This observation suggests  reduced dietary intake of PUFA in these patients that might contribute to their  cardiovascular risk."|"pufa,patients,membrane,cholesterol,hdl"|"pufa,membrane,mets,patients,cholesterol" 
"AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the association between xanthine  dehydrogenase (XDH) gene polymorphism and essential hypertension in the rural Han  Chinese population of Fuxin, Liaoning. Han Chinese individuals, who had lived in   rural areas of Fuxin, were selected as subjects for the present study. A total of  521 unrelated patients with hypertension were selected, along with a further 533   unrelated individuals with normal blood pressure, in order to serve as controls.   Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the XDH gene were selected. An   estimation of SNP allele frequency was determined using DNA pooling and  pyrosequencing methods. Prior to Bonferroni correction, T allele frequency for  rs206811 was significantly higher in patients with hypertension, as compared with  the controls (64.1 vs. 59.4%; P=0.031); C allele frequency for rs1042039 was  significantly higher in patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls  (66.1 vs. 60.6%; P=0.011), C allele frequency for rs1054889 was significantly  lower in patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls (38.8 vs.  44.8%; P=0.007); and A allele frequency for rs2073316 was significantly lower in   patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls (29.2 vs. 34.4%;  P=0.013). However, once a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied,  the XDH gene polymorphisms rs1042039, rs1054889, and rs2073316 were shown to be  associated with hypertension (P=0.044, 0.035, and 0.039, respectively). These  results suggest that the XDH gene polymorphisms rs1042039, rs1054889, and  rs2073316 may be associated with hypertension in the rural Han Chinese  population."|"hypertension,xdh,gene,frequency,selected"|"hypertension,allele,controls,frequency,patients" 
"AB  - Hypertension is recognized as one of the major contributing factors to  cardiovascular disease, but its etiology remains incompletely understood. Known  genetic and environmental influences can only explain a small part of the  variability in cardiovascular disease risk. The missing heritability is currently  one of the most important challenges in blood pressure and hypertension genetics.  Recently, some promising approaches have emerged that move beyond the DNA  sequence and focus on identification of blood pressure genes regulated by  epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and  microRNAs. This review summarizes information on gene-environmental interactions   that lead toward the developmental programming of hypertension with specific  reference to epigenetics and provides pediatricians and pediatric cardiologists  with a more complete understanding of its pathogenesis."|"hypertension,dna,environmental,disease,cardiovascular"|"hypertension,blood,cardiovascular,disease,dna"

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of 5 mg perindopril arginine salt  and 4 mg perindopril tert-butylamine salt for patients with mild to moderate  essential hypertension. METHODS: The study was designed as multicenter,  randomized, double-blind, active controlled trial with two parallel groups  enrolling 524 participants with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After  2-week run-in period, 186 patients were enrolled and randomly treated with 5 mg  perindopril arginine salt and 183 patients were enrolled and randomly treated  with 4 mg perindopril tert-butylamine salt. The random sequence was generated by   the I.R.I.S., and a balance was made in each center. After double-blind treatment  for 8 weeks, the dose could be doubled for patients with uncontrolled BP ((SBP)  >/= 140 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >/= 90 mmHg)   and patients were treated for another 4 weeks. RESULTS: The sitting SBP was  similarly decreased by (19.9 +/- 17.2) mmHg in perindopril arginine group and  (18.5 +/- 14.7) mmHg (P = 0.000 5) in perindopril tert-butylamine group post 8  weeks treatment. Dose was doubled in 109 patients (59.9%) in perindopril arginine  group and 116 patients (63.7%) in perindopril tert-butylamine group. At 12 weeks   post therapy, the sitting SBP decreased by (19.8 +/- 16.2) and (19.6 +/- 16.3)  mmHg respectively in the 2 groups. The decrease of sitting DBP was also similar  in both groups (-12.0 +/- 10.0) mmHg and (-11.0 +/- 8.9) mmHg (P < 0.000 1),  respectively. The control rate or response rate was also similar between the two   groups (control rate over 8 weeks was 38.5% vs. 31.3%, 95% CI (-2.6-16.9),  control rate over 12 weeks was 36.3% vs. 35.7%, 95% CI (-9.3-10.4), response rate  over 8 weeks was 64.3% vs. 63.2%, 95% CI (-8.8-11.0), response rate over 12 weeks  was 65.9% vs. 64.8%, 95% CI (-8.7-10.9)). Incidence of adverse events was low and  similar in both therapy groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that perindopril  arginine salt 5 mg is as efficient as perindopril tert-butylamine 4 mg on  lowering BP for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs  have good safety profile and are well tolerated by patients in this cohort."|"patients,mmhg,weeks,groups,perindopril"|"perindopril,patients,mmhg,weeks,mg" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between serum pregnancy-associated plasma   protein-A (PAPP-A) level, and essential hypertension (EH) and hypertensive  disorders in pregnancy (HDP) in Chinese population. METHODS: Pertinent studies  were independently searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese  Biomedical Database (CBM), Wanfang databases and China National Knowledge  Infrastructure (CNKI). The standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs was  used to estimate the size of the effect. The subgroup analyses and  meta-regression analysis were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity   among studies. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the   results. The publication bias between studies was examined by using Begg's funnel  plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies involving 1493 patients  and 1839 controls were included in the current meta-analysis. The PAPP-A level  was significantly higher in EH patients than in controls (SMD=1.960, 95% CI 1.305  to 2.615, p<0.001), and significant associations were observed in all subgroups.   The PAPP-A level was also significantly higher in HDP patients than in healthy  pregnant women (SMD=2.249; 95% CI 1.324 to 3.173, p<0.001). The positive  association between PAPP-A level and the risk of HDP was consistently observed in  all subgroups except the subgroup with low NOS score. CONCLUSIONS: The present  meta-analysis suggests that an elevated PAPP-A level may be associated with  susceptibilities to EH and HDP."|"studies,analysis,papp,hdp,level"|"level,papp,analysis,hdp,studies" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of  cardiovascular disease. We aim in this study to analyse the relationship between   AGT M235T gene variant and ACE I/D gene variant with essential hypertension in a   sample of the Algerian population of the Oran city. A case-control study has been  performed in 145 subjects including; 75 hypertensives and 70 controls from  Algerian population of Oran city. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with  restrictive fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to detect the M235T  variant of angiotensinogen (AGT) gene and a nested PCR to determine ACE I/D gene   variant. The genotypic and allelic distribution of the M235Tvariant of the AGT  gene did not differ in hypertensives and normotensives group (X(2) =7.81, P<0.05;  X(2) =4.67, respectively) thus there was no association between the T allele and   hypertension (OR=1.64; 95%CI [1.01-2.69]). The genotypic and allelic frequencies   of the ACE I/D variant did differ significantly between hypertensives and  controls (X(2)=13.98, P<0.05; X(2) =12.66, P<0.05, respectively) where a  significant association between the D allele of the ACE I/D gene and essential  hypertension has been observed (OR=0.46; 95%CI [0.27-0.75]). We reported a high  prevalence of the D and T allele in hypertensives female. This study shows that  the M235T variant of the AGT gene is not associated with essential hypertension  while a significant association has been reported with the D allele in this  sample of Algerian population of the Oran city."|"gene,variant,agt,hypertension,study"|"gene,variant,hypertension,ace,agt" 
"AB  - Hypertension is a common disorder of multifactorial origin that constitutes a  major risk factor for cardiovascular events such as stroke and myocardial  infarction. The subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins are attractive  candidate gene products for susceptibility to hypertension, obesity and insulin  resistance syndrome. A polymorphism (825C/T) in exon 10 of the GNB3 gene,  encoding for the Gbeta3 subunit, has been described. The 825T allele is  associated with alternative splicing of the gene and formation of a truncated but  functionally active beta3 subunit. Many studies have investigated whether  carriers of the 825T allele are at increased risk for hypertension, obesity,  insulin-resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy with apparently conflicting  results. The present review demonstrates that GNB3 825T allele is a useful  genetic marker for better defining the risk profile of hypertensive patients, as   it is associated with increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in  longitudinal studies in Caucasians."|"risk,gene,allele,hypertension,subunit"|"risk,825t,allele,gene,hypertension" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effects of aqueous extract of  Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) on the three basic components of  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: Plasma renin, serum angiotensin-converting   enzyme (ACE), and plasma aldosterone (PA) in mild to moderate essential  hypertensive Nigerians and compared with that of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double-blind controlled randomized clinical study was  used. Seventy-eight newly diagnosed but untreated mild to moderate hypertensive  subjects attending Medical Outpatients Clinic of Enugu State University Teaching   Hospital, Enugu were recruited for the study. Those in Group A received placebo  (150 mg/kg/day), Group B were given lisinopril (10 mg once daily) while those in   Group C received aqueous extract of HS (150 mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks of  treatment, the levels of plasma renin, serum ACE, and PA were determined.  RESULTS: HS and lisinopril significantly (P < 0.001) reduced PA compared to  placebo by 32.06% and 30.01%, respectively. Their effects on serum ACE and plasma  renin activity (PRA) were not significant compared to placebo; they reduced ACE  by 6.63% and 5.67% but increased plasma PRA by 2.77% and 5.36%, respectively.  CONCLUSION: HS reduced serum ACE and PA in mild to moderate hypertensive  Nigerians with equal efficacy as lisinopril. These actions are possibly due to  the presence of anthocyanins in the extract."|"ace,lisinopril,study,hs,renin"|"ace,plasma,hs,lisinopril,pa" 
"AB  - CONTEXT: The role of vasopressin (AVP) in the pathophysiology of primary  aldosteronism (PA) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was  to investigate AVP secretion in PA by measuring the plasma concentration of  copeptin (PCop), the C-terminal portion of provasopressin. The secondary aim was   to assess renal sensitivity to AVP. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a  cross-sectional study in a tertiary-care hospital. PROTOCOL: We recruited 115  patients with PA, 48 patients with essential hypertension (EH), and 108  normotensive healthy subjects (HS). Blood was sampled for biochemical and  hormonal evaluations in fasting condition after 1-h rest in supine position.  Osmolality was determined in 24-h urine. PCop was determined by immunoassay. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was adjusted difference in PCop between  groups. RESULTS: After adjustment for sex, body mass index, systolic blood  pressure, natremia, and kalemia, PCop was significantly higher in patients with  PA than in HS (geometric mean ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI],  1.26-2.06; P < .0001) and patients with EH (1.40; 95% CI, 1.08-1.82; P = .0070)  PCop was positively correlated with natremia (P = .0094). Urine osmolality was  significantly lower in patients with PA than in HS (0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P =   .0002) and 24-h urinary output was significantly higher in patients with PA than   in HS (1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .0005). The relationship between urine  osmolality and PCop was shifted downward in patients with PA but was similar in  patients with EH and HS, indicating peripheral resistance to AVP. CONCLUSION:  PCop increases in patients with PA in response to an increase in natremia and a  renal resistance phenomenon, indicating that AVP release is chronically  stimulated in PA."|"pa,pcop,avp,patients,hs"|"pa,patients,pcop,avp,hs" 
"AB  - This study aimed to examine the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  and morning blood pressure surge in never-treated patients with essential  hypertension. This prospective study included a total of 58 patients (mean age,  51.7 years; 55.2% men) with never-treated essential hypertension. The patients  were divided into non-OSA (n=23, 49.3+/-12.7 years) and OSA (n=35, 53.2+/-9.8  years) groups. The OSA group was defined as having an apnea-hypopnea index level   >5 as measured by the Watch-PAT 200. The authors collected 24-hour ambulatory BP,  plasma aldosterone concentration, and plasma renin activity data from all of the   patients. The measured sleep-trough morning systolic blood pressure (SBP)  increases were higher in the OSA group than in the non-OSA group (28.7+/-11.8 mm   Hg vs 19.6+/-12.8 mm Hg, P=.008). The sleep-trough morning SBP increase was  inversely correlated with the lowest oxygen saturation (r=-0.272, P=.039). OSA  known to be associated with increased daytime and nocturnal sympathetic activity   was associated with significantly higher sleep-trough morning SBP levels in this   study."|"osa,patients,sleep,morning,trough"|"osa,morning,patients,sleep,group" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate relationship between gamma glutamyl  transferase (GGT) activity with paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity and aortic  stiffness (AS) parameters such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation  index (AIx). METHODS: Measurements were obtained from 324 patients with newly  diagnosed essential hypertension (mean age: 55.0 +/- 8.2 years). The patients  were divided into two groups according to their median GGT values. PWV and AIx  were calculated using the single-point method via the Mobil-O-Graph(R) ARCsolver   algorithm. RESULTS: PWV, Aix, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)  values were higher and PON1 activity values were lower in GGThigh group compared   with GGTlow group (P < 0.05, for all). Multiple linear regression analysis showed  that GGT activity was independently associated with PWV (beta = 0.496, P < 0.001)  and PON1 activity (beta = -0.343, P < 0.001) as well as hs-CRP (beta = 0.334, P <  0.001). CONCLUSION: These results may support that increased GGT activity would  be associated with both impaired antioxidant system and increased AS in  hypertensive patients."|"activity,ggt,pwv,aix,patients"|"activity,ggt,pwv,001,aix" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systemically investigate the association between the polymorphism  (rs3118869) in cathepsin Lenzyme gene with hypertension in three ethnic groups  (Han, Kazak and Uygur) in China. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. PLACE AND  DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital,  Shihezi Medical College, Shihezi University and Department of Internal Medicine  and Genetic Diagnosis Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong  University of Science and Technology, from January 2013 to May 2014. METHODOLOGY:  This case-control study included 1224 patients (422 Uygur, 425 Kazak and 377 Han   individuals) with hypertension and 967 healthy unrelated individuals (339 Uygur,   337 Kazak and 291 Han individuals) as controls. The participants came from three   ethnic groups (Han, Kazak and Uygur) which were recruited from Xinjiang Province   of China. The polymorphism (rs3118869) of the human cathepsin Lgene was genotyped  using the TaqMan 5' nuclease assay. Binary logistic regression was built to  determine the association of polymorphism with hypertension. RESULTS: The  genotype distribution of polymorphism was not significantly different in three  ethnic groups. The rs3118869 polymorphism was significantly associated with  Essential Hypertension (EH) in co-dominant model (A/C vs. C/C) in total people  (OR = 0.697, 95% CI = 0.520 -0.932, p = 0.015), the same result was obtained in  recessive model (C/C + A/C vs. A/A) in total people (OR = 0.689, 95% CI = 0.522  -0.910, p = 0.009). Similar finding of rs3118869 in recessive model (C/C + A/C  vs. A/A) was also observed after adjusting the variable to the covariates age (OR  = 0.629, 95% CI = 0.464 0853, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The study results indicate   the A-allele of rs3118869 is a protective factor in hypertension."|"rs3118869,hypertension,polymorphism,study,model"|"hypertension,polymorphism,rs3118869,study,han" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test if collagen markers are associated with aldosterone-induced  diastolic dysfunction. BACKGROUND: Although primary aldosteronism is associated  with more prominent cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction, the  reversibility of diastolic function is unclear. In addition, there is no known  biomarker associated with aldosterone-induced diastolic dysfunction. METHODS: We   enrolled 27 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) preparing for  adrenalectomy, and 27 patients with essential hypertension prospectively from  October 2006 to March 2010 at a tertiary referral center. Plasma matrix  metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1  (TIMP-1) were measured, and echocardiography including tissue Doppler images was   performed in both groups and 1 year after receiving adrenalectomy in the APA  group. RESULTS: The baseline plasma TIMP-1 level (88.4 +/- 38.7 vs. 63.6 +/- 32.5  ng/ml; P = 0.014), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and E/E' ratio (11.5 +/-  2.9 vs. 9.0 +/- 2.1; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the APA group. The  baseline plasma TIMP-1 level significantly correlated with the E/E' ratio, LVMI,   interventricular septum, and left atrial diameter. The plasma MMP-2 level did not  correlate with the left ventricular structure parameters, except for  interventricular septum thickness. After adrenalectomy, LVMI and E/E' ratio  improved significantly. The postadrenalectomy plasma TIMP-1 levels, but not MMP-2  levels, also decreased. The change of plasma TIMP-1 levels was negatively  associated with the postadrenalectomy E/E' ratio after adjustment for age, sex,  BMI, and mean blood pressure (beta-coefficient = - 3.6, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION:  Excess of aldosterone induces cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which is reversible   by adrenalectomy. TIMP-1 is associated with the aldosterone-induced diastolic  dysfunction."|"timp,associated,plasma,adrenalectomy,aldosterone"|"diastolic,plasma,timp,aldosterone,associated" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin II receptor type 1 mediates the major cardiovascular  effects of angiotensin II to regulate blood pressure. Polymorphisms of  angiotensin II receptor type 1 are associated with essential hypertension, but  the results are inconsistent and conflicting. The aim of the present study is to   assess the association between angiotensin II receptor type 1 polymorphisms and  essential hypertension risk in Chinese Hani and Yi minorities. METHODS: This  study recruited 692 unrelated Chinese Hani subjects (case vs. control = 346:346)   and 615 unrelated Chinese Yi subjects (case vs. control = 303:312). Twelve  selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in the angiotensin II receptor type 1  gene were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length  polymorphism method. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated that the GC+CC  genotype of rs387967 was significantly associated with the decreased  susceptibility to essential hypertension compared with GG in a Yi population  (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence intervals 0.41-0.83, P = 0.003). Allele C was   a protective allele for essential hypertension (odds ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence  intervals 0.61-0.99, P = 0.040). This association was confirmed respectively by  comparing systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure between different   genotypes and between different alleles, which indicated that the genotype  (GC+CC) had a tendency of lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood  pressure than GG (PSBP = 3.716 x 10(-4), PDBP = 1.187 x 10(-3)); Carriers with C   had lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (PSBP = 7.301 x  10(-3), PDBP = 9.142 x 10(-4)). Another single nucleotide polymorphism  (rs2638360) was analysed in a Hani minority, then replicated in a Yi minority.  The C allele showed a consistent risk trend for essential hypertension in two  independent populations (Hani: odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence intervals  1.01-2.99, P = 0.046; Yi: odds ratio = 1.27, 95% confidence intervals 0.82-1.96,   P = 0.277). Meta-analysis revealed that the C allele could significantly increase  the risk of essential hypertension (odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence intervals  1.02-2.02, P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rs387967 is  associated with the susceptibility to essential hypertension in a Yi population  and the tendency was replicated in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood  pressure detection. Meta-analysis revealed that C allele of rs2638360 could  significantly increase the risk of essential hypertension. The two single  nucleotide polymorphisms maybe play a role in the pathology of essential  hypertension."|"essential,hypertension,yi,blood,pressure"|"blood,essential,hypertension,pressure,yi" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: AGT is the first gene to be linked to essential hypertension (EHT).  It harbors several variants of which only few polymorphisms are found to exhibit   positive and negative associations with hypertension. In the present study, the  AGT gene was screened to detect already reported and novel variations  contributing to the development of hypertension. METHOD: In total, 215  hypertensives and 230 normotensives were screened for variations in all the five   exons and a part of promoter of AGT gene using single strand conformation  polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing of samples showing mobility shifts  on polyacrylamide gels. RESULTS: Five novel variants, namely c.-61G>A in  promoter, c.-4+17C>T in intron1, c.24T>C and c.28A>T in Exon2, and c.*90 T>C in  3' untranslated region were detected in the AGT gene. c.-61G>A lies in the  promoter region that plays a critical role in its expression. Variation  c.-4+17C>T created a new enhancer site. c.24T>C (TCT-TCC) is a silent mutation  while c.28A>T (p. M10L) has a possible damaging effect on the AGT protein.  c.*90T>C, detected in the 3' untranslated region is thought to play an important   role in the translation and stability of the mRNA. CONCLUSION: Studies on the  functional role of these novel variants are warranted to understand the mechanism  underlying the development of EHT."|"c,agt,gene,hypertension,novel"|"agt,gene,hypertension,novel,promoter" 
"AB  - There is a high incidence of glucose intolerance in essential hypertension.  Overactivation of the sympathetic system is one of important causes of essential   hypertension. Whether sympathetic system affects glucose metabolism in patients  with essential hypertension has never been reported previously. The aim of this  study was to explore the association between the sympathetic system activity and   glucose metabolism in patients with essential hypertension. A total of 202  essential hypertension inpatients without diabetes were recruited from Shanghai  Ruijin Hospital between February 2006 and August 2013. Activity of sympathetic  system was quantified by plasma metanephrines (MNs) levels. All subjects received  an oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour plasma glucose   increased significantly across the quartiles of plasma MNs. The multiple linear  regression analysis revealed that plasma MNs were significantly associated with  fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour plasma glucose. The area under curve of plasma   glucose increased significantly from the lowest plasma MNs quartile across to the  highest quartile. The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that odds  ratios (95% confidence interval) for prediabetes in the highest quartile compared  with the lowest quartile of plasma MNs was 4.00 (95% confidence interval,  1.16-13.86). Plasma MNs levels are positively associated with plasma glucose in  patients with essential hypertension. Patients with high plasma MNs levels had an  increased risk of prediabetes."|"plasma,glucose,mns,essential,hypertension"|"plasma,glucose,mns,essential,hypertension" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between alpha epithelial sodium channel   (alpha-ENaC) T663A polymorphism and the risk of essential hypertension. METHODS:   This meta-analysis was conducted between November 2014 and February 2015 in  published available case-control data (N=12) identified through PubMed, Web of  Science, Scopus, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to  December 2014. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was  calculated using the fixed- or random-effect model. RESULTS: Although subgroup  analysis showed that alpha-ENaC T663A polymorphism was associated with essential   hypertension in North American individuals (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.22-1.98, p=0.0003),  our meta-analysis results did not confirm such association overall (OR=1.03, 95%   CI=0.92-1.15, p=0.62). The lack of association was further confirmed by the  non-superiority test (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Alpha-ENaC T663A  polymorphism might not be a risk factor for essential hypertension."|"alpha,analysis,enac,ci,t663a"|"alpha,95,analysis,ci,enac" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between serum  leptin, adiponectin, visfatin levels and obesity and essential hypertension in  female subjects. METHODS: According to BMI and blood pressure, 206 female  participants enrolled were divided into four groups: group 1: obesity and  hypertension (48 cases); group 2: non-obesity but hypertension (48 cases); group   3: obesity and normotension (56 cases) and group 4: normal BMI and blood pressure  (54 cases). Serum leptin, adiponectin and visfatin levels were detected and their  relationships to BMI, blood pressure and waist circumference were analysed.  RESULTS: Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in non-obese groups [group  2: (4.47 +/- 1.26) ng/L, group 4: (3.73 +/- 1.18) ng/L] than in obese groups  [group 1: (2.97 +/- 1.46) ng/L, group 3: (3.02 +/- 1.18) ng/L], and higher in  hypertension groups than in normotension groups. Serum adiponectin levels were  obviously higher in group 4 [38.99 (19.75, 103.71) microg/L] than in the other  three groups. There were no significant differences in adiponectin levels among  group 1, 2 and 3. Serum levels of visfatin were lower in normotension groups  [group 3: 3.19 (0.96, 9.45) ng/L; group 4:3.23 (1.92, 4.64) ng/L] than in  hypertension groups [group 1: 3.84 (3.40, 5.35) ng/L; group 2: 3.75(1.63, 6.67)  ng/L] irrespective of obesity. Logistics regression analysis showed that there  was 1.6%, 8.3%, or 5.45% increased risk for hypertension for each 1 microg/L  decrease in adiponectin, 1 cm increase in waist circumference, or 1 microg/L  increase in visfatin level in obesity, respectively. No relationship could be  viewed between leptin and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin and visfatin  levels were correlated with obesity and blood pressure in females. Both  adipokines may play a crucial role in the development of hypertension in female  obesity."|"obesity,hypertension,adiponectin,levels,group"|"group,groups,hypertension,ng,obesity" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs with combined alpha and beta blocking activity are commonly  prescribed to treat hypertension. However, the blood pressure (BP) lowering  efficacy of this class of beta blockers has not been systematically reviewed and   quantified. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the dose-related effects of various types of   dual alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers (dual receptor blockers) on  systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in patients with primary  hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group  Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled  trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry  Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.  SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized double blind placebo controlled parallel or  cross-over trials. Studies contained a beta blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed   dose. Patients enrolled in the studies had primary hypertension at baseline.  Duration of the studies was from three to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta  blockers are carvedilol, dilevalol and labetalol. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:  Two review authors (GW and AL) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted  the data independently. RevMan 5.3 was used to synthesize data. MAIN RESULTS: We   included eight studies examining the blood pressure lowering efficacy of  carvedilol and labetalol in 1493 hypertensive patients. Five of the included  studies were parallel design; three were cross-over design. The two largest  included studies were unpublished carvedilol studies. The estimates of BP  lowering effect (systolic BP/diastolic BP millimeters of mercury; SPB/DBP mm Hg)   were -4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals (CI) -6 to -2)/-3 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -2)  for carvedilol (>1000 subjects) and -10 mm Hg (95% CI -14 to -7)/-7 mm Hg (95% CI  -9 to -5) for labetalol (110 subjects). The effect of labetalol is likely to be  exaggerated due to high risk of bias. Carvedilol, within the recommended dose  range, did not show a significant dose response effect for SBP or DBP. Carvedilol  had little or no effect on pulse pressure (-1 mm Hg) and did not change BP  variability. Overall, once and twice the starting dose of carvedilol and  labetalol lowered BP by -6 mm Hg (95% CI -7 to -4) /-4 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -3)  (low quality evidence) and lowered heart rate by five beats per minute (95% CI -6  to -4) (low quality evidence). Five studies (N = 1412) reported withdrawal due to  adverse effects; the risk ratio was 0.88 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.42) (moderate quality   evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides low quality evidence that  in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, dual receptor blockers lowered  trough BP by an average of -6/-4 mm Hg and reduced heart rate by five beats per  minute. Due to the larger sample size from the two unpublished studies,  carvedilol provided a better estimate of BP lowering effect than labetalol. The  BP lowering estimate from combining carvedilol once and twice the starting doses   is -4/-3 mm Hg. Doses higher than the recommended starting dose did not provide  additional BP reduction. Higher doses of dual receptor blockers caused more  bradycardia than lower doses. Based on indirect comparison with other classes of   drugs, the blood pressure lowering effect of dual alpha- and beta-receptor  blockers is less than non-selective, beta1 selective and partial agonist beta  blockers, as well as thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system.  Dual blockers also had little or no effect on reducing pulse pressure, which is  similar to the other beta-blocker classes, but less than the average reduction of  pulse pressure seen with thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin  system. Patients taking dual receptor blockers were not more likely to withdraw  from the study compared to patients taking placebo."|"studies,blockers,beta,carvedilol,bp"|"blockers,bp,hg,mm,studies" 
"AB  - Mounting evidence has implicated the SLC12A3 gene in essential hypertension.  Here, we examined the potential associations of common variants of the SLC12A3  gene with blood pressure traits in Mongolians in China. Genomic DNA was extracted  from 508 unrelated Mongolian patients with essential hypertension and 246  normotensive Mongolian subjects for genotyping. The genotype distributions of all  selected polymorphisms were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The  presence of the G allele in the rs7187932 polymorphism was found to be associated  with an increased risk of hypertension (OR: 1.30; 95%CI = 1.00-1.38; P = 0.048),   whereas the rs2399594 G allele was associated with a reduced risk for  hypertension (OR: 0.76; 95%CI = 0.60-0.97; P = 0.030). No significant difference   was observed for other alleles. Haplotype analysis revealed an association of the  rs2399594 and rs711746 GG haplotype with a reduced risk for hypertension (OR:  0.76; 95%CI = 0.60-0.97; P = 0.029). No significant association was observed  between other haplotypes and hypertension. These results suggest that the SLC12A3  gene is a susceptibility gene for hypertension in the Mongolian population."|"hypertension,gene,slc12a3,mongolian,allele"|"hypertension,gene,95,ci,mongolian" 
"AB  - Myotrophin, known as a myocardial hypertrophy-inducing factor, is responsible for  the initiation of cardiac hypertrophy that transits to heart failure. MicroRNAs  are small noncoding RNAs that down-regulate posttranscriptional expression of  target molecules. We investigated the role of variants of the microRNA-binding  site in myotrophin in affecting its expression and any association with cardiac  hypertrophy. Bioinformatics demonstrated that variant rs17168525 was identified  to be located in the let-7/miR-98-binding site of myotrophin. We further  experimentally test to effects of the identified variant on myotrophin  translation using luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting. We found that  the C allele of rs17168525 suppressed myotrophin translation by facilitating  let-7c binding, but not the T allele. Let-7c overexpression caused a significant   decrease in the level of myotrophin protein. Next, we investigated the  association of the variant with cardiac hypertrophy in 1614 hypertensive  patients, including 552 with left ventricular hypertrophy and 1062 without left  ventricular hypertrophy, as well as 591 healthy control subjects from a Han  Chinese population. No significant association between the variant rs17168525 and  left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients in a Han Chinese population  (P>0.05). In conclusion, our experimental results provide evidence that the T  allele of rs17168525 in the 3'-UTR of myotrophin might influence the level of  myotrophin protein by interfering with let-7/miR-98 binding."|"myotrophin,hypertrophy,rs17168525,variant,cardiac"|"myotrophin,hypertrophy,binding,let,rs17168525" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thiazide diuretics are associated with increased risk of diabetes  mellitus. This risk may arise from K(+)-depletion. We hypothesised that a  K(+)-sparing diuretic will improve glucose tolerance, and that combination of  low-dose thiazide with K(+)-sparing diuretic will improve both blood pressure  reduction and glucose tolerance, compared to a high-dose thiazide. METHODS AND  ANALYSIS: This is a parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial,   comparing hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg, amiloride 10-20 mg and combination of  both diuretics at half these doses. A single-blind placebo run-in of 1 month is  followed by 24 weeks of blinded active treatment. There is forced dose-doubling  after 3 months. The Primary end point is the blood glucose 2 h after oral  ingestion of a 75 g glucose drink (OGTT), following overnight fasting. The  primary outcome is the difference between 2 h glucose at weeks 0, 12 and 24.  Secondary outcomes include the changes in home systolic blood pressure (BP) and  glycated haemoglobin and prediction of response by baseline plasma renin.  Eligibility criteria are: age 18-79, systolic BP on permitted background  treatment >/= 140 mm Hg and home BP >/= 130 mm Hg and one component of the  metabolic syndrome additional to hypertension. Principal exclusions are diabetes,  estimated-glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min, abnormal plasma K(+), clinic SBP  >200 mm Hg or DBP >120 mm Hg (box 2). The sample size calculation indicates that   486 patients will give 80% power at alpha=0.01 to detect a difference in means of  1 mmol/L (SD=2.2) between 2 h glucose on hydrochlorothiazide and comparators.  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PATHWAY-3 was approved by Cambridge South Ethics  Committee, number 09/H035/19. The trial results will be published in a  peer-reviewed scientific journal.

"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that more intensive initial therapy  for hypertension results in better long-term blood pressure (BP) control. We test  this hypothesis comparing initial monotherapy with dual therapy in the management  of essential hypertension. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a prospective,  multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with essential  hypertension. Around 50% of patients studied will be newly diagnosed and the  others will be known hypertensives who previously received only monotherapy. The   trial is divided into three phases as follows: Phase 1 (Week 0-Week 16):  Randomised, parallel-group, masked assignation to either combination or  monotherapy. Phase 2 (Week 17-Week 32): Open-label combination therapy. Phase 3  (Week 33-Week 52): Open-label combination therapy plus open-label add-on (if BP  is above 140/90 mm Hg). Hierarchical primary end points are: a comparison of home  BP (home systolic blood pressure (HSBP)) averaged over the duration of phase 1  and 2 in the combination versus monotherapy arms. If combination is superior in  this analysis, then the averaged mean HSBP between initial monotherapy and  initial combination therapy at the end of phase 2 will be compared. Secondary end  points include: BP control at 1 year; the role of age, baseline renin, sodium  status, plasma volume, haemodynamic compensation and peripheral resistance on BP   control; validation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/British  Hypertension Society joint guideline algorithm; safety and tolerability of  combination therapy; and the impact of combination versus monotherapy on left  ventricular mass and aortic pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 536 (268 in  each group) will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4 mm Hg.  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PATHWAY 1 was approved by UK ethics (REC Reference  09/H0308/132). Trial results will be published and all participating subjects  will be informed of the results.

"AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Iron accumulation within the arterial wall has been  hypothesized to promote atherosclerosis progression. Aim of this study was to  evaluate whether the hormone hepcidin and iron stores are associated with  arterial stiffness in subjects with essential hypertension. METHODS: Circulating   hepcidin, ferritin, and mutations in the hemochromatosis gene were compared  between subjects included in the first vs. third tertile (n=284 each) of  carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) in an unselected cohort of patients  with arterial hypertension. RESULTS: At univariate logistic regression analysis,   high PWV was associated with higher ferritin levels (p=0.010), but lower hepcidin  (p=0.045), and hepcidin ferritin/ratio (p<0.001). Hemochromatosis mutations  predisposing to iron overload were associated with high PWV (p=0.025). At  multivariate logistic regression analysis, high aortic stiffness was associated  with older age, male sex, lower BMI, higher systolic blood pressure and heart  rate, hyperferritinemia (OR 2.05, 95% c.i. 1.11-3.17 per log ng/ml; p=0.022), and  lower circulating hepcidin concentration (OR 0.29, 95% c.i. 0.16-0.51 per log  ng/ml; p<0.001). In subgroup analyses, high PWV was associated with indices of  target organ damage, including micro-albuminuria (n=125, p=0.038), lower ejection  fraction (n=175, p=0.031), cardiac diastolic dysfunction (p=0.004), and lower S  wave peak systolic velocity (p<0.001). Ferritin was associated with cardiac  diastolic dysfunction, independently of confounders (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In  conclusion, hyperferritinemia is associated with high aortic stiffness and  cardiac diastolic dysfunction, while low circulating hepcidin with high aortic  stiffness."|"associated,high,hepcidin,pwv,lower"|"associated,hepcidin,high,lower,ferritin" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) have  been associated with diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, and other  cardiovascular diseases; however, results of these studies are still  controversial. In this study, we sought to determine whether 2 functional  variants (rs1801133 and rs13306560) within the MTHFR are associated with  hypertension in Mexican-Mestizos. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a  case-control study with 1214 subjects including adults and children to test for  the association of both single nucleotide polymorphisms with essential  hypertension. The adult group included 764 participants (372 patients and 391  controls) and the group of children included 418 participants (209 patients and  209 controls). rs13306560 was associated with essential hypertension in adults  (odds ratio, 4.281; 95% confidence interval, 1.841-9.955; P=0.0003) with a  statistical power >0.8. In children, none of the polymorphisms was associated  with essential hypertension. In addition, we assessed the effect of the  rs13306560 polymorphism on the MTHFR promoter region by means of luciferase  reporter gene assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Cells  transfected with the pMTHFRaLUC construct showed an approximately 25% reduction  in luciferase activity (P=0.003). Furthermore, the promoter activity was reduced   considerably by in vitro methylation of CpG sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our data  suggest that the rs13306560 polymorphism of the MTHFR may be part of the observed  hypertension process in Mexican-Mestizo populations, but further studies are  warranted. In addition, the allele A of the rs13306560 polymorphism as well as  the in vitro methylation of CpGs reduced the promoter activity of the MTHFR  regulatory region."|"hypertension,mthfr,rs13306560,associated,children"|"hypertension,mthfr,rs13306560,associated,activity" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  the lercanidipine/valsartan combination compared with lercanidipine monotherapy  in patients with hypertension. METHODS: Part 1 of this study was the randomized,   multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, Phase III, 8-week clinical trial to  compare superiority of lercanidipine 10 mg/valsartan 80 mg (L10/V80) and  lercanidipine 10 mg/valsartan 160 mg (L10/V160) combinations with lercanidipine  10 mg (L10) monotherapy. At screening, hypertensive patients, whose diastolic  blood pressure (DBP) was >90 mm Hg after 4 weeks with L10, were randomized to 3  groups of L10, L10/V80, and L10/V160. The primary end point was the change in the  mean sitting DBP from baseline (week 0) after 8 weeks of therapy. Patients who  were randomly assigned to L10/V160 and whose mean DBP was still >/= 90 mm Hg in  part 1 were enrolled to the up-titration extension study with lercanidipine 20  mg/valsartan 160 mg (L20/V160) (part 2). FINDINGS: Of 772 patients screened, 497   were randomized to 3 groups (166 in the L10 group, 168 in the L10/V80 group, and   163 in the L10/V160 group). Mean (SD) age was 55 (9.9) years, and male patients  comprised 69%. The mean (SD) baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP)/DBP were  148.4 (15.1)/94.3 (9.5) mm Hg. No significant differences were found between  groups in baseline characteristics except the percentages of previous history of   antihypertensive medication. The primary end points, the changes of mean (SD) DBP  at week 8 from the baseline were -2.0 (8.8) mm Hg in the L10 group, -6.7 (8.5) mm  Hg in L10/V80 group, and -8.1 (8.4) mm Hg in L10/V160 group. The adjusted mean  difference between the combination groups and the L10 monotherapy group was -4.6   mm Hg (95% CI, -6.5 to -2.6; P < 0.001) in the L10/V80 group and -5.9 mm Hg (95%   CI, -7.9 to -4.0, P < 0.001) in the L10/V160 group, which had significantly  greater efficacy in BP lowering. A total of 74 patients were enrolled in the part  2 extension study. Changes of mean (SD) DBP and SBP from week 8 to week 12 and  week 16 were -5.6 (7.9)/-8.0 (12.0) mm Hg and -5.5 (7.0)/-8.5 (11.3) mm Hg,  respectively. For evaluation of the safety profile, the frequencies of adverse  events between groups were also not significantly different. The most frequently   reported adverse events were headache (6 cases, 20.7%) in the L10 group,  dizziness (8 cases, 16.3%) in L10/V80 group, and nasopharyngitis (3 cases, 9.4%)   in L10/V160 group, and the incidences of adverse events were not different  between groups. IMPLICATIONS: Treatment of L10/V80 or L10/V160 combination  therapy resulted in significantly greater BP lowering compared with L10  monotherapy. Moreover, the L20/V160 high dose combination had additional BP  lowering effect compared with nonresponders with the L10/V160 combination."|"l10,v160,group,patients,mean"|"l10,group,v160,hg,mm" 
"AB  - AIM: The variance in hypertension-related sequelae between different ethnic  groups is highly related to differences in socioeconomic conditions and lifestyle  habits, but also to disparities in the awareness and treatment of the disease. In  the present study, we sought to evaluate the target organ damage in a vulnerable   hypertensive population, such as the Eastern European immigrants. METHODS: The  study population consisted of 128 hypertensive patients: 67 immigrants from  Eastern Europe and 61 native inhabitants. Anthropometric, biochemical and  echocardiographic data were derived from both groups. Both groups underwent  fundoscopic examination and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements for assessment  of arterial stiffness. RESULTS: Although immigrants had lower body mass index  compared to native inhabitants (P<0.001), they had significantly increased  arterial stiffness (P=0.003). In multivariate analysis, higher carotid-femoral  PWV was significantly associated with immigration status [beta (SE)=0.935(0.443),  P=0.041], after adjustment for smoking status. Moreover, immigrants had increased  left atrial volume index (LAVI) (P<0.001), left ventricular mass index (P<0.001)   and higher rates of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (p=0.047). In  multivariate analysis, LAVI was significantly associated with immigration status   (beta (SE)=5.17(1.93), P=0.01) after adjustment for serum glucose levels and age.  Finally, immigrants had significantly higher levels of sodium urinary excretion  (p=0.007) and lower glomerular filtration rate (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our  findings suggest that hypertensive immigrants exhibit an aggravated arterial  stiffness profile and increased risk of target organ damage. These findings could  be attributed to differences in socioeconomic conditions and dietary habits."|"immigrants,significantly,groups,higher,increased"|"immigrants,001,significantly,arterial,groups" 
"AB  - Behavioral performance and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)  represent cerebrovascular reserve and may indicate functional deficits related to  essential hypertension. Fifteen stage 1 hypertensive and normotensive males  (19-55 years) were compared on four tests of working memory (digit span and  auditory consonant trigrams), and accompanying hemodynamic changes measured by  functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). With participants blindfolded, the  four tests were randomized while fNIRS was used to monitor bilateral PFC changes   in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb), and  hemoglobin difference. The hypertensive group demonstrated significant impairment  in performance on the working memory tests with a trend of decreased efficiency  performance scores (tests score/O2Hb and tHb changes). Significant correlations  were noted in the hypertensive group between test performance and changes in O2Hb  and tHb in both the left and right PFC. These findings suggest that fNIRS  combined with cognitive testing may provide important measures of cerebrovascular  reserve in essential hypertension."|"changes,tests,performance,pfc,fnirs"|"changes,performance,tests,fnirs,hypertensive" 
"AB  - CONTEXT: Aldosterone (ALD) secretion is regulated mainly by angiotensin II, K(+),  and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists  (MRAs) have effectively been used for the treatment of patients with hypertension  who do not have primary aldosteronism (PA). OBJECTIVE: We tested whether chronic   stress-related ACTH-mediated ALD hypersecretion and/or zona glomerulosa  hypersensitivity could be implicated in the pathogenesis of essential  hypertension (ESHT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirteen hypertensives  without PA and 61 normotensive controls underwent an ultralow-dose (0.03-mug)  ACTH stimulation and a treadmill test. Patients with ALD hyper-response according  to the cutoffs obtained from controls received treatment with MRAs and underwent   genomic DNA testing for the presence of the CYP11B1/CYP11B2 chimeric gene and  KCNJ5 gene mutations. A control group of 22 patients with simple ESHT received  treatment with MRAs. RESULTS: Based on the cutoffs of ALD and  aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) post-ACTH stimulation obtained from controls, 30  patients (27%) exhibited an ALD but not cortisol (F) hyper-response (HYPER  group). This group had no difference in basal ACTH/renin (REN) concentrations  compared with controls and the 83 patients with hypertension (73%) without an ALD  hyper-response to ACTH stimulation. Patients in the HYPER group demonstrated  significantly higher ALD concentrations, ARR, and ALD/ACTH ratio (AAR) in the  treadmill test. Treatment with MRAs alone produced normalization of blood  pressure in these patients whereas patients with hypertension with neither PA nor  ALD hyper-response to ACTH stimulation who served as a control group failed to  lower blood pressure. Also, two novel germline heterozygous KCNJ5 mutations were   detected in the HYPER group. CONCLUSIONS: A number of patients with hypertension   without PA show ACTH-dependent ALD hyper-secretion and benefit from treatment  with MRAs. This could be related to chronic stress via ACTH hyper secretion  and/or gene-mutations increasing the zona glomerulosa responsiveness to  excitatory stimuli."|"acth,patients,ald,hyper,mras"|"acth,ald,patients,hyper,group" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term blood pressure (BP)  variability (BPV) derived from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in  patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), either idiopathic hyperaldosteronism  (IHA) or aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), in comparison with patients with  essential hypertension (EH) and normotensive (NT) controls. Thirty patients with   PA (16 with IHA and 14 with APA), 30 patients with EH, and 30 NT controls,  matched for sex, age, body mass index, and antihypertensive therapy, were  studied. The standard deviation (SD) of 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime BP;  24-hour weighted SD of BP; and 24-hour BP average real variability were not  different between patients with PA and those with EH (P=not significant). All BPV  indices were higher in patients with PA, either IHA or APA subtypes, and patients  with EH, compared with NT controls (P<.001 to P<.05). ABPM-derived short-term BPV  is increased in patients with PA, and it may represent an additional  cardiovascular risk factor in this disease. The role of aldosterone excess in BPV  has to be clarified."|"patients,pa,bpv,eh,bp"|"patients,pa,bp,bpv,eh" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chemerin is a new adipokine elevated in states of obesity and  metabolic syndromes. In this study, we investigated the association of increased   chemerin on endothelial function, arterial stiffness and early atherosclerosis in  essential hypertensive patients. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-seven newly  diagnosed essential hypertensive patients were enrolled. Anthropometric  measurements and plasma parameters were examined, including BMI, waist  circumference, glucose, serum insulin, lipid profiles, chemerin, high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-4. Vascular  health was assessed with brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), brachial-ankle   pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). RESULTS:  In hypertensive patients, plasma chemerin levels were higher in women than in men  (P < 0.05). In univariate analysis, the plasma chemerin level was positively  correlated with baPWV (men: r = 0.58, P < 0.01; women: r = 0.51, P < 0.01) and  carotid IMT (men: r = 0.17, P = 0.01; women: r = 0.20, P = 0.01), and inversely  correlated with FMD (men: r = -0.54, P < 0.01; women: r = -0.44, P < 0.01). The  associations for FMD and baPWV, but not IMT, remained significant in  multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles,   inflammation markers and adipokines. More importantly, logistic regression  analysis revealed that high chemerin level was an independent predictor of  impaired endothelial function (FMD odds ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval  1.28-3.30, P = 0.03) and increased arterial stiffness (baPWV odds ratio 3.75, 95%  confidence interval 1.36-5.28, P < 0.01), even after adjustment for metabolic  variables, inflammatory markers and adipokines. CONCLUSION: Chemerin levels were   independently associated with the index of arterial function and early  atherosclerosis in essential hypertension."|"chemerin,bapwv,fmd,plasma,patients"|"01,chemerin,bapwv,fmd,men" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is commonly accompanied by a dysfunction of glucose  metabolism. Glucokinase (GCK) is a key enzyme involved in glucose metabolism. The  aim of the present study was to investigate whether GCK gene-body methylation  contributed to the risk of EH. A total of 47 patients with EH and 47 age-matched   controls were recruited for methylation research in the current study. GCK  gene-body methylation was measured using bisulphite pyrosequencing technology.  DNA methylation levels were closely correlated among CpG1, CpG2 and CpG3 (r>0.70;  P<0.001), in contrast with a weaker correlation between CpG4 and the preceding  three CpGs (r<0.3 or r=1; P>0.05). Significantly lower CpG13 methylation (cases  vs. controls, 49.13 +/- 5.72 vs. 53.49 +/- 7.53%; adjusted P=0.006) and  significantly higher CpG4 methylation (cases vs. controls, 46.34 +/- 6.48 vs.  34.74 +/- 12.73%; adjusted P=0.002) were observed in patients with EH. The  present study indicated that aberrant methylation of the GCK gene body was  significantly associated with the risk of EH in the population assessed. The  discrepancies between CpG13 and CpG4 methylation may suggest distinct roles for  each of them in the determination of the risk of EH."|"methylation,eh,gck,cpg4,study"|"methylation,eh,gck,vs,body" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between visit-to-visit blood pressure (BP)   variability (BPV) and vascular endothelial function in a cohort of elderly  hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of 174 elderly patients with essential  hypertension were included in the study. The participants had their office BP  measured during the 12-month follow-up. Right brachial artery diameter was  assessed at rest, during reactive hyperemia (flow-mediated dilation, FMD), and  after nitroglycerin administration (nitroglycerin-mediated dilation, NMD). The  participants were divided into two groups according to FMD% or FMD/NMD ratio. The  correlations between BPV and endothelial function were analyzed by univariate  analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The participants  classified as having a decreased endothelial function according to FMD/NMD ratio   had significantly lower FMD% and higher BPV and NMD% (P<0.05). The percentage of   CCBs use in normal endothelial function group was significantly higher than that   in decreased endothelial function group (79.55% vs 63.95%, P<0.05). Multiple  linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between  FMD/NMD ratio and BPV, and this association remained significant after adjustment  for age, body mass index, and mean BP levels. CONCLUSIONS: FMD/NMD ratio is a  better marker of endothelial function than FMD, and an increased visit-to-visit  variability of BP is associated with a decreased endothelial function."|"function,endothelial,fmd,nmd,bp"|"fmd,endothelial,function,nmd,bp" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and 66A/G  and 524C/T polymorphisms of methionine synthase reductase (MSR) gene with  essential hypertension (EH) in ethnic Uygurs and Hans from Xinjiang. METHODS:  From September 2011 to July 2014, 199 Uyghur and 216 Han patients were collected,  while 195 healthy Uyghur ethnics and 217 healthy Han ethnics were recruited as  the controls. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length  polymorphism (PCR-RELP) was adopted to detect the above polymorphisms. Enzyme  immunological assay was applied to measure the levels of plasma Hcy. RESULTS:  Compared with the control, plasma Hcy levels were significantly higher in EH  group in both Uyghur and Han ethnics (P<0.05). In both ethnic groups, there were   also significant differences in MSR 524C/T polymorphism between the patients and   controls (Uyghur: chi-square=6.559, P=0.038; Han: chi-square=12.684, P=0.002). No  significant difference was found in MSR 66A/G polymorphism between the patients  and controls in both ethnic groups (P>0.05). Plasma Hcy level in those with a  66G/524C genotype was statistically higher than that with 66A/524T (P<0.05).  After adjusting confounding factors such as gender and age, Logistic regression  analysis indicated that age (OR=1.924, 95% CI:1.177- 3.164, P=0.009), obesity  (OR=2.491, 95% CI: 1.584-3.920, P<0.01), hyperhomocysteine (OR=1.609, 95% CI:  1.016-2.548, P=0.043) were independent risk factors for EH in Uygurs, while age  (OR=1.133, 95% CI: 1.010-81.272, P=0.033), hyperhomocysteine level (OR=3.894, 95%  CI: 2.432-6.237, P<0.01), and obesity (OR=1.864, 95% CI: 1.141-3.046, P=0.013)  were independent risk factors for EH in Han ethnics. No association was found  between the polymorphisms and EH in Uygurs and Hans. CONCLUSION: Age,  hyperhomocysteine and obesity were common independent risk factors for EH in both  Uygur and Han ethnics from Xinjiang. The MSR 66G genotype can increase the plasma  concentration of Hcy, while MSR 524T genotype may reduce it. MSR 524C/T TT  genotype may be a protective factor for EH. MSR polymorphisms 66A/G and 524C/T  are not independent risk factors for EH in Uygur and Han ethnics from Xinjiang.  journal of medical genetics"|"msr,eh,c,plasma,hcy"|"eh,han,msr,95,ci" 
"AB  - Salusin beta is a multifunctional bioactive peptide and is considered as a  promising candidate biomarker for predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular  diseases. The present study was designed to investigate the roles and mechanisms   of salusin beta in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in attenuating hypertension   and hypothalamic inflammation and whether central salusin beta blockade has  protective effects in essential hypertension. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)  rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used in this study. The rats   were chronic PVN infusion either specific salusin beta blocker, antisalusin beta   IgG (SIgG), or control IgG (CIgG) for 2 weeks. Hypertensive rats had  significantly increased salusin beta expression compared with normotensive rats.   Central blockade of salusin beta attenuated hypertension, reduced circulating  norepinephrine (NE) levels, and improved cardiac hypertrophy and function in  hypertensive rats. Salusin beta blockade significantly reduced proinflammatory  cytokines (PICs), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity, reactive oxygen  species (ROS) levels, and altered renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in  the PVN of hypertensive rats. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects   of salusin beta blockade in essential hypertension are possibly due to  down-regulate of inflammatory molecules and ROS in the PVN."|"beta,salusin,rats,hypertension,hypertensive"|"beta,salusin,rats,blockade,hypertension" 
"AB  - Activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) may be involved in essential  hypertension (EH) by induction of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) and radical oxygen  species (ROSs) production. Abnormal expression of ATF1 was found in EH in  previous microarray analysis. Here we tested whether a single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of ATF1 was  associated with EH susceptibility by affecting microRNA (miRNA) binding. In  silico analysis indicated that rs11169571 (T>C) was a candidate SNP to modulate  miRNA: ATF1 mRNA complex, with the greatest changed energy for hsa-miR-1283, and   the luciferase reporter analysis showed that miR-1283 inhibited the activity of  the reporter vector carrying -T allele, but not the -C allele. In addition,  inhibition of miR-1283 in HA-VSMCs enhanced the expression of ATF1 mRNA as well  as the ROS levels. Further case-control study showed that rs11169571 was  significantly associated with increased risk of EH. Finally, we observed an  increased ATF1 protein level in peripheral blood of EH patients with CC carriers   compared to TT carriers of rs11169571, with an intermediate ATF1 level in TC  carriers. These results suggested that rs11169571 of ATF1 gene may be associated   with EH, and the SNP-modified posttranscriptional gene regulation by miRNAs could  be a potentially pathogenetic mechanism of EH."|"atf1,eh,rs11169571,snp,analysis"|"atf1,eh,rs11169571,1283,analysis" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: The coexistence of essential hypertension (EH) in type 2 diabetic  (T2D) patients greatly enhances chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the  acute renal dysfunction in two cohorts of diabetic-hypertensive subjects. The  inaugural pathology for each group is either T2D or EH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The  study was undertaken on 506 subjects who were divided in 5 groups according to  age and sex: diabetic, hypertensive, diabetic- hypertensive (DH and HD) and  healthy groups. Patients were phenotyped regarding their cardiometabolic syndrome  (CMS) profile using the NCEP/ATPIII criteria and cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)  according to the International kidney foundation. Hypertension was defined as  systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure >/= 140/90 mmHg, respectively.   Insulin resistance (IR) was assessed by Homa-IR model. Glomerular filtration rate  (GFR) by creatinine clearance. CMS and CRS parameters were determined on  Cobas(R). The SBP and DBP measurements by electronic blood pressure using Omron  705 CP(R) type. RESULTS: IR was found in all diabetics and hypertensive patients.  Dyslipidemia are correlated to % body fat mass accretion in all groups. In DH  group, the renal disorder is confirmed by decreased GFR (30%) and increased  microalbuminuria (> 30 mg/24h); associated with increased NT-pro BNP and plasma  aldosterone depletion. CONCLUSION: Several biomarkers are necessary to detection   kidney disease and renal failure prevention in diabetic patients to hypertensive   state. The renal dysfunction was significantly related to T2D-EH disease."|"patients,diabetic,renal,hypertensive,kidney"|"diabetic,hypertensive,patients,renal,disease" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether rs12731181 (A-->G) interrupted  miR-590-3p-mediated suppression of the prostaglandin F2alpha receptor (FP) and  whether it is associated with essential hypertension in the Chinese population.  APPROACH AND RESULTS: We found that miR-590-3p regulates human FP gene expression  by binding to its 3'-untranslated region. rs12731181 (A-->G) altered the binding   affinity between miR-590-3p and its FP 3'-untranslated region target, thus  reducing the suppression of FP expression, which, in turn, enhanced FP  receptor-mediated contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells. Overexpression  of FP augmented vascular tone and elevated blood pressure in mice. An association  study was performed to analyze the relationship between the FP gene and essential  hypertension in the Han Chinese population. The results indicated that the  rs12731181 G allele was associated with susceptibility to essential hypertension.  Carriers of the AG genotype exhibited significantly higher blood pressure than  those of the AA genotype. FP gene expression was significantly higher in human  peripheral leukocytes from individuals with the AG genotype than that in  leukocytes from individuals with the AA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: rs12731181 in the   seed region of the miR-590-3p target site is associated with increased risk of  essential hypertension and represents a new paradigm for FP involvement in blood   pressure regulation."|"fp,essential,rs12731181,hypertension,mir"|"fp,3p,590,essential,genotype" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: Determination of the relationship between the estimated total volume of   the carotid bodies (VrCB+lCB), assessed by computed tomography angiography (CTA),  and the autonomic cardiac function in patients with essential hypertension (EH).   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 69 patients with diagnosed and  pharmacologically treated EH. The estimated volume of each carotid body (CB) was   evaluated on the basis of scans obtained in the CTA of carotid arteries, using  the following formula: 4/3xpixhalf of transverse dimension of CB in axial  projectionxhalf of longitudinal dimension of CB in the axial projectionxhalf of  craniocaudal dimension of CB in the sagittal/coronal projection. Cardiac  autonomic function was assessed using time domain analysis of heart rate  variability (HRV). RESULTS: The mean values of SDNNi, rMSSD and pNN50 at 24-h  monitoring, during daily activity and during night rest, were significantly lower  in patients with hypertension with the values of VrCB+lCB>/=median compared to  the group of hypertensive patients with the values of VrCB+lCB<median. Moreover,   in patients with EH with the values of VrCB+lCB>/=median, the mean values of SDNN  were lower during daily activity. Based on the regression analysis, it was found   out that the higher values of VrCB+lCB are an independent risk factor in HRV  reduction (expressed as a reduction in the rMSSD). CONCLUSION: In patients with  EH, a relationship between the volume of CB, assessed by CTA of carotid arteries,  and autonomic cardiac function seems to be probable."|"patients,values,cb,eh,vrcb"|"patients,values,cb,lcb,vrcb" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a widespread disease and might be prevalent in  apnea divers and master athletes. Little is known about the influence of EH and  the antihypertensive drugs (AHD) on cardiovascular reactions to combined breath  hold (BH) and exercise. In this pilot study, healthy divers (HCON) were compared   with treated hypertensive divers with regard to heart rate (HR) and mean  blood-pressure (MAP) responses to BH, exercise and the combination of both. Ten  subjects with EH and ten healthy divers were tested. 3 different 20 s stimuli  were applied: BH combined with 30 W or 150 W and 150 W without BH. The  time-charts during the stress intervals and during recovery were compared.  Subjects treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor showed  higher changes for MAP values if breath hold was performed. HR responses were  obviously changed if a beta-blocker was part of the medication. One subject  showed extreme MAP responses to all stimuli and conspicuous HR if BH was  involved. The modulation of HR-/MAP-response in EH subjects depends on the  mechanisms of antihypertensive agents. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and a   beta-blocker may give the best protection. It is recommended to include short  apnea tests in the fitness-to-dive examination to individually predict potential   endangerment."|"map,eh,bh,divers,hr"|"bh,divers,eh,hr,map" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection  fraction is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.  Population-based survey studied the associations between diastolic dysfunction in  primary hypertension and its association with lifestyle--as one of risk factors.   Exercise prevents and prolongs the degenerative changes but whether leisure time   physical activity (LTPA) is associated with similar effects is being studied  here. METHODS: Total 301 patients of age 30-60 year old with essential  hypertension were included in prospective observational study. Patients were  classified according to their leisure time physical activity and subjected for  echocardiography and color Doppler. RESULTS: Out of 301 patients, 149 (49.66%)  were sedentary during leisure time, out of which 114 (76.5%) were having  diastolic dysfunction and 35 (23.5%) were normal, while 104 (34.66%) were having   moderate physical activity in which 66 (63%) were normal. Twenty-nine (60%) of 48  vigorously active were found to be normal. By using Fisher's exact test p-value  was < 0.05.

"AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess renal cortical perfusion parameter changes using computed  tomography (CT) renal perfusion examination in patients with essential  hypertension (EH), especially those with EH-related target organ damage (TOD),  and to correlate renal perfusion parameters with clinical and laboratory data.  METHODS: Consecutive patients with EH (without exclusion criteria) and healthy  controls underwent 128-slice dual-source CT perfusion imaging. Quantitative  perfusion analysis of renal cortex parameters [blood flow (BF), blood volume,  time to peak, and mean transit time] was performed. RESULTS: Ninety-one  participants (60 patients with EH, 31 healthy controls) underwent renal perfusion  CT imaging, and 84 participants (92.3%) were eligible for perfusion analysis. The  BF values were lower in patients with EH than that in controls. Blood flow was  correlated with age (P < 0.01), duration of hypertension (P < 0.01), estimated  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; P < 0.01), pulse pressure (P < 0.05), and body   mass index (BMI; P < 0.05). Duration of hypertension, eGFR, and BMI were  independently associated with BF. No parameter differed between control subjects   and those with EH but not. Blood flow was lower in patients with TOD than in  control subjects (P < 0.01), but no other parameter differed. Blood flow was  lower (P < 0.01) and mean transit time and time to peak were higher (P < 0.05) in  the TOD than that in the non-TOD group. CONCLUSIONS: Essential hypertension,  especially EH-related TOD, alters renal cortical perfusion parameters, especially  BF. Four-dimensional spiral CT renal perfusion examination showed that duration  of hypertension, eGFR, and BMI were independently associated with decreased BF."|"perfusion,renal,eh,tod,bf"|"perfusion,eh,renal,01,bf" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adrenergic activation and baroreflex dysfunction are common in  established essential hypertension, elderly hypertension, masked and white-coat  hypertension, resistant hypertension, and obesity-related hypertension. Whether  this autonomic behavior is peculiar to established hypertension or is also  detectable in the earlier clinical phases of the disease, that is, the  high-normal blood pressure (BP) state, is still largely undefined, however.  METHODS: In 24 individuals with optimal BP (age: 37.1 +/- 2.1 years, mean +/-  SEM) and in 27 with normal BP and 38 with high-normal BP, age matched with  optimal BP, we measured clinic, 24-h and beat-to-beat BP, heart rate (HR), and  muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) at rest and during baroreceptor  stimulation and deactivation. Measurements also included anthropometric as well  as echocardiographic and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. RESULTS: For   similar anthropometric values, clinic, 24-h ambulatory, and beat-to-beat BPs were  significantly greater in normal BP than in optimal BP. This was the case when the  high-normal BP group was compared to the normal and optimal BP groups. MSNA (but   not HR) was also significantly greater in high-normal BP than in normal BP and  optimal BP (51.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 40.3 +/- 2.3 and 41.1 +/- 2.6 bursts per 100  heartbeats, respectively, P < 0.01). The sympathetic activation seen in  high-normal BP was coupled with an impairment of baroreflex HR control (but not  MSNA) and with a significant increase in HOMA Index, which showed a significant  direct relationship with MSNA. CONCLUSION: Thus, independently of which BP the  diagnosis is based, high-normal BP is a condition characterized by a sympathetic   activation. This neurogenic alteration, which is likely to be triggered by  metabolic rather than reflex alterations, might be involved, together with other   factors, in the progression of the condition to established hypertension.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have been proposed as a  replacement therapy after the occurrence of either an angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema or cough. However, recent studies  indicate that angioedema is associated with elevated bradykinin levels in a small  fraction of patients treated with angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, suggesting a   common pathophysiological mechanism. To date, a standard treatment for  angiotensin II receptor blocker-induced angioedema does not exist. METHODS: We  present a case series of patients admitted to our hospital due to angioedema  induced by an angiotensin II receptor blocker. The patients were either treated  with either icatibant (n = 3) or prednisolone-21-hydrogen succinate/clemastine (n  = 5). Both patient groups were compared with an untreated patient cohort (n = 3).  All patients were previously diagnosed with essential hypertonia. RESULTS:  Icatibant was an effective therapy for angiotensin II receptor blocker-induced  angioedema. Full symptom recovery was achieved after 5 to 7 hours, whereas  symptom remission occurred within 27 to 52 and 24 to 54 hours in patients treated  with Solu-Decortin prednisolone/clemastine and untreated patients, respectively.   The recovery time for icatibant was similar to that described in previous studies  regarding the therapeutic efficacy of icatibant for the treatment of hereditary  angioedema and patients suffering from angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitor-induced angioedema. CONCLUSIONS: Icatibant is a safe and effective  substance for the treatment of angiotensin II receptor blocker-induced  angioedema. Although the pathophysiology of angiotensin II receptor  blocker-induced angioedema remains unclear, it appears to be associated with the   bradykinin pathway."|"patients,angioedema,angiotensin,icatibant,induced"|"angioedema,angiotensin,ii,induced,patients" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the aging law on anti-hypertensive effect of scrapping  therapy on primary hypertension so as to provide the reference evidence for the  best treatment frequency of scrapping therapy. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients of  primary hypertension complied with inclusive criteria were treated with scrapping  therapy according to syndrome differentiation. The stimulated sites included the   courses of the governor vessel and the bladder meridian on the neck and back  region, the line from Quchi (LI 11) to Shousanli (LI 10) and that from Zusanli  (ST 36) to Fenglong (ST 40). The strong stimulation for reducing attempt was  applied to the case of excessi syndrome, determined by subcutaneous capillary  rupture and subcutaneous blood stasis. The mild stimulation for reinforcing  attempt was applied to the case of deficiency syndrome, determined by  subcutaneous capillary hyperemia and skin flush. Each site was scrapped for 10  times, about 5 cm in width, for 15 min. One scrapping treatment was required. The  blood pressure was taken as the observation index separately, named 2:00 pm, 2:30  pm, 3:00 pm, 3:30 pm, 4:00 pm, 5:00 pm, 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm one day before  scrapping, the time before scrapping in the afternoon on the day of treatment,  the moment (2:00 pm), 2:30 pm, 3:00 pm; 3:30 pm, 4:00 pm, 5:00 pm, 6:00 pm and  8:00 pm after scrapping, in 24 h and 48 h after scrapping. RESULTS: (1) After one  scrapping, the blood pressure was reduced to be (137. 51+/-10. 24)/(81. 06+/-10.   56) mmHg half a hour after scrapping from (149. 00+/-10. 19)/(85. 30+/-10. 96)  mmHg (1mmHg~0. 133 kPa) before scrapping (P<0. 01). (2) The differences were  significant in blood pressure at each time point after scrapping as compared with  that before scrapping (all P<0. 01). (3) Through nonlinear regression analysis,  the systolic blood pressure after scrapping was increased up to 140 mmHg in 47. 2  h after scrapping. CONCLUSION: Scrapping therapy achieves the apparent immediate   anti-hypertensive effect on primary hypertension. It is suitable to apply  scrapping treatment once every other day."|"scrapping,blood,therapy,pressure,treatment"|"scrapping,pm,00,10,30" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major public health problem that increases the risk  of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown an inverse  association between calcium intake and blood pressure. As small reductions in  blood pressure have been shown to produce rapid reductions in vascular disease  risk even in individuals with normal blood pressure ranges, this review intends  to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation in normotensive individuals as   a preventive health measure. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of  calcium supplementation versus placebo or control for reducing blood pressure in   normotensive people. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group   Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for  randomised controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical  Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's  Specialised Register. We also reviewed reference lists from retrieved studies and  contacted authors of relevant papers. We applied no language restrictions.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected trials that randomised normotensive people to  dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification  versus placebo or control. We excluded quasi-random designs. The primary outcomes  were hypertension (defined as blood pressure >/= 140/90 mmHg) and blood pressure   measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected  trials for inclusion, abstracted the data and assessed the risks of bias. MAIN  RESULTS: We included 16 trials with 3048 participants. None of the studies  reported hypertension as a dichotomous outcome. The effect on systolic and  diastolic blood pressure was mean difference (MD) -1.43 mmHg (95% confidence  interval (CI) -2.15 to -0.72) and -0.98 mmHg (95%CI -1.46 to -0.50) respectively.  The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those younger than 35  years (7 trials with 399 participants) was -2.11 mmHg (95%CI -3.58 to -0.64) /  -2.61 mmHg (95% CI -3.74, -1.49). The effect on systolic and diastolic blood  pressure for those 35 years or more (9 trials with 2649 participants) was -0.96  mmHg (95%CI -1.83 to -0.09) / -0.59 mmHg (95%CI -1.13 to -0.06). The effect on  systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women (6 trials with 1823 participants)  was -1.45 mmHg (95% CI -2.78 to -0.12) / -0.92 mmHg (95% CI -1.71 to -0.14). The   effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for men (5 trials with 617  participants) was -2.07 (95%CI -3.56 to -0.59] / -1.91 (95%CI -2.80 to -1.02).The  quality of evidence for each of these outcomes was high. The effect is consistent  in both genders regardless of baseline calcium intake.The effect on systolic  blood pressure was 0.08 mmHg (95% CI -2.16 to 2.32) with doses less than 1000 mg,  -1.14 mmHg (95% CI -2.01 to -0.27) with 1000 - 1500 mg, and -2.79 mmHg (95% CI  -4.71 to -0.86) with more than 1500 mg. The effect on diastolic blood pressure  was -0.54 mmHg (95% CI -2.23 to 1.15), -0.71 mmHg (95% CI -1.37 to -0.06) and  -1.43 mmHg (95% CI -2.22 to -0.64) respectively. The quality of evidence for each  of these outcomes was high.None of the studies reported adverse events. AUTHORS'   CONCLUSIONS: An increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and  diastolic blood pressure in normotensive people, particularly in young people,  suggesting a role in the prevention of hypertension. These results should be  interpreted with caution, since the proposed biological mechanism explaining the   relationship between calcium and blood pressure has not been fully confirmed. The  effect across multiple prespecified subgroups and a possible dose response effect  reinforce this conclusion. Even small reductions in blood pressure could have  important health implications for reducing vascular disease.There is a great need  for adequately-powered clinical trials randomising young people. Subgroup  analysis should involve basal calcium intake, age, sex, basal blood pressure, and  body mass index. We also require assessment of side effects, optimal doses and  the best strategy to improve calcium intake."|"blood,pressure,calcium,trials,effect"|"blood,pressure,95,ci,mmhg" 
"AB  - AIM: The aim was to elucidate whether essential hypertension is associated with  altered capillary morphology and density and to what extent exercise training can  normalize these parameters. METHODS: To investigate angiogenesis and capillary  morphology in essential hypertension, muscle biopsies were obtained from m.  vastus lateralis in subjects with essential hypertension (n = 10) and  normotensive controls (n = 11) before and after 8 weeks of aerobic exercise  training. Morphometry was performed after transmission electron microscopy, and  protein levels of several angioregulatory factors were determined. RESULTS: At  baseline, capillary density and capillary-to-fibre ratio were not different  between the two groups. However, the hypertensive subjects had 9% lower capillary  area (12.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 13.9 +/- 0.2 mum(2)) and tended to have thicker capillary   basement membranes (399 +/- 16 vs. 358 +/- 13 nm; P = 0.094) than controls.  Protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2   and thrombospondin-1 were similar in normotensive and hypertensive subjects, but   tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase was 69% lower in the hypertensive  group. After training, angiogenesis was evident by 15% increased  capillary-to-fibre ratio in the hypertensive subjects only. Capillary area and  capillary lumen area were increased by 7 and 15% in the hypertensive patients,  whereas capillary basement membrane thickness was decreased by 17% (P < 0.05).  VEGF expression after training was increased in both groups, whereas VEGF  receptor-2 was decreased by 25% in the hypertensive patients(P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Essential hypertension is associated with decreased lumen area and a   tendency for increased basement membrane thickening in capillaries of skeletal  muscle. Exercise training may improve the diffusion conditions in essential  hypertension by altering capillary structure and capillary number."|"capillary,essential,training,hypertensive,hypertension"|"capillary,hypertensive,essential,hypertension,training" 
"AB  - Despite extensive debate about the first choice for treating essential  hypertension, monotherapy effectively normalizes blood pressure (BP) values in  only a limited number of hypertensive patients. Thus, the aim of combination  therapy should always be to both improve BP control and to reduce cardiovascular   events. Antihypertensive drugs can be effectively combined if they have different  and complementary mechanisms of action. This is crucial to obtain additive  BP-lowering effects without impacting on tolerability. One typical combination is  the association of drugs blocking and stimulating the renin-angiotensin system  (RAS) (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor  blocker and calcium antagonist or diuretic, respectively). In contrast, some  combinations (e.g., calcium antagonists plus diuretics or beta-blockers plus RAS   blockers) have no additive BP-lowering effects, while other combinations (e.g.,  clonidine plus alpha-1 receptor blockers) can have a negative interaction.  Regardless, BP reduction is not the only mechanism that reduces cardiovascular  risk. Scientific evidence indicates that some drug classes are better than others  in this respect, and therefore some drug combinations are also better than  others. The results of the ASCOT-BPLA and ACCOMPLISH trials suggested that an ACE  inhibitor/calcium antagonist combination had better cardioprotective effects than  beta-blocker/diuretic or ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. It is worth noting   that no controlled clinical trials have used hard endpoints when investigating  the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker/calcium antagonist combination. In  conclusion, combination therapy is needed for optimal antihypertensive  management, with the first choice being an ACE inhibitor plus a calcium  antagonist. This approach should improve BP control and provide better  cardiovascular protection."|"bp,combination,better,effects,calcium"|"bp,calcium,combination,ace,angiotensin" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: The present study compared the Doppler flow pulsatility indices (PI) in   the uterine arteries (UtA) during the puerperium between healthy women and those   with stage-1 essential hypertension who had uncomplicated pregnancies and  delivered by elective caesarean section. The change in the mean arterial pressure  (MAP) and body mass index (BMI) over time was also assessed. METHODS: A  longitudinal and prospective study was performed in singleton pregnancies of 28  normotensive (NT) and 24 hypertensive (HT) women. The UtA-PI was measured  immediately before caesarean section (time 0) and at 1 week (time 1) and 4 weeks   (time 2) postpartum. The presence or absence of early diastolic notches was  recorded. The change in the MAP, BMI, and UtA-PI over time and between the two  populations was modelled through multivariate linear regression using the  generalised least squares. RESULTS: In both groups, the UtA-PI significantly  increased from time 0 to time 1 (p < 0.05) and time 2 (p < 0.05). Stage-1  hypertension did not change the trend but did increase the UtA-PI magnitude (p <   0.05). The presence of uterine artery notching increased over time, from 6 to  98%, in both groups (p < 0.001); however, in the HT group, at time 1, the  majority of women exhibited positive notching [92% (HT) vs 57% (NT), p = 0.013].   CONCLUSIONS: Chronic stage-1 hypertensive women with normal pregnancy outcomes  exhibited a progressively increasing postpartum UtA impedance. This trend also  occurred in normotensive women, albeit at a significantly lower magnitude."|"time,uta,women,pi,change"|"time,uta,pi,women,05" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The fluctuation of circadian blood pressure (BP) is of  great diversity in patients with essential hypertension and may provide  significant prognostic value for stroke. However, it remains uncertain whether  reverse-dipper pattern of BP influences the incidence of lacunar infarction in  hypertensive patients. METHODS: In the current study, 362 hypertensive patients  (195 males, 167 females) were enrolled. BP patterns were evaluated with 24-h  ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Multinomial logistic regression was applied to  analyse the possible relationships between lacunar infarction and various  clinical risk factors such as ABPM. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients (25.7%) had  reverse-dipper BP pattern. Non-dipper pattern of BP was observed in 179  hypertensive patients (49.4%) and dipper pattern in 90 patients (24.9%). The  percentage of lacunar infarction was the highest in the patients with  reverse-dipper pattern compared with pure hypertension or atherothrombotic  cerebral infarction (P < 0.05). After multinomial logistic regression analysis,  reverse-dipper pattern of BP (odds ratio 2.492; 95% confidence interval  1.133-5.479; P < 0.05) and age (odds ratio 1.084; 95% confidence interval  1.047-1.123; P < 0.01) were found to be directly associated with lacunar  infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse-dipper BP pattern may serve as an independent  risk factor for lacunar infarction and more personalized BP management should be   offered to the patients who have elevated nocturnal BP."|"bp,infarction,patients,pattern,lacunar"|"bp,patients,dipper,pattern,infarction" 
"AB  - Aldosterone has hypertrophic and profibrotic effects on the heart. The  relationship between plasma aldosterone levels and left ventricular diastolic  function in hypertension, however, is unclear. The aim of this study was to  examine this relationship in treatment-naive hypertensive patients free of  comorbidities that could affect left ventricular diastolic filling properties. In  115 patients with primary hypertension who were eating a standard diet and 100  matched normotensive controls, we measured plasma aldosterone and active renin  levels and performed both conventional echocardiography and tissue-Doppler  imaging for assessment of left ventricular diastolic function. Left ventricular  hypertrophy was found in 21% of hypertensive patients, and diastolic dysfunction   was detected in 20% by conventional echocardiography and in 58% by tissue-Doppler  imaging. Patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction at tissue-Doppler  imaging were older and more frequently men, had greater body mass index, blood  pressure, alcohol intake, left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness,  and lower plasma aldosterone levels than patients with preserved diastolic  function. Plasma aldosterone correlated directly with left ventricular mass index  in addition to age, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Plasma  aldosterone was also directly related to e' velocity at tissue-Doppler imaging,  but this relationship was lost after multivariate adjustment. In conclusion,  plasma aldosterone levels are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy but  have no independent relationship with left ventricular diastolic properties in  hypertensive patients."|"ventricular,left,aldosterone,plasma,patients"|"left,ventricular,aldosterone,diastolic,patients" 
"AB  - The authors aimed to analyze the relationship between subclinical renal damage,  defined as the presence of microalbuminuria or an estimated glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR) between 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and short-term  blood pressure (BP) variability, assessed as average real variability (ARV),  weighted standard deviation (SD) of 24-hour BP, and SD of daytime and nighttime  BP. A total of 328 hypertensive patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP  monitoring, 24-hour albumin excretion rate determination, and eGFR calculation  using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. ARV of  24-hour systolic BP (SBP) was significantly higher in patients with subclinical  renal damage (P=.001). This association held (P=.04) after adjustment for  potential confounders. In patients with microalbuminuria, ARV of 24-hour SBP,  weighted SD of 24-hour SBP, and SD of daytime SBP were also independently and  inversely related to eGFR. These results seem to suggest that in essential  hypertension, short-term BP variability is independently associated with early  renal abnormalities."|"bp,hour,egfr,renal,arv"|"24,bp,hour,sbp,sd" 
"AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of conventional and new markers of   early cardiac organ damage (OD) on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in 25  outpatients with newly diagnosed untreated essential hypertension compared with  15 normotensive, otherwise healthy individuals. Each participant underwent ECG,  echocardiographic, and blood pressure (BP) measurements. Conventional and new ECG  indexes for cardiac OD (Tp-Te interval, ventricular activation time, and P-wave  analysis) were also measured. Clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BP levels as well as   left ventricular mass indexes were significantly higher in hypertensive than in  normotensive patients. No significant differences were found between the two  groups for ECG and echocardiographic markers of OD. Only Tp-Te interval was  higher in hypertensive than in normotensive individuals (3.06 mm vs 2.24 mm;  P<.0001), even after adjustment for anthropometric and clinical parameters.  Preliminary results of this study demonstrated prolonged Tp-Te interval in newly   diagnosed, untreated hypertensive outpatients compared with normotensive  individuals."|"ecg,normotensive,tp,te,hypertensive"|"ecg,normotensive,hypertensive,individuals,interval" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiazide diuretics have been recommended as a first-line  antihypertensive treatment, although the choice of 'the right drug in the  individual essential hypertensive patient' remains still empirical. Essential  hypertension is a complex, polygenic disease derived from the interaction of  patient's genetic background with the environment. Pharmacogenomics could be a  useful tool to pinpoint gene variants involved in antihypertensive drug response,  thus optimizing therapeutic advantages and minimizing side effects. METHODS AND  RESULTS: We looked for variants associated with blood pressure response to  hydrochlorothiazide over an 8-week follow-up by means of a genome-wide  association analysis in two Italian cohorts of never-treated essential  hypertensive patients: 343 samples from Sardinia and 142 from Milan. TET2 and  CSMD1 as plausible candidate genes to affect SBP response to hydrochlorothiazide   were identified. The specificity of our findings for hydrochlorothiazide was  confirmed in an independent cohort of essential hypertensive patients treated  with losartan. Our best findings were also tested for replication in four  independent hypertensive samples of European Ancestry, such as GENetics of drug  RESponsiveness in essential hypertension, Genetic Epidemiology of Responses to  Antihypertensives, NORdic DILtiazem intervention, Pharmacogenomics Evaluation of   Antihypertensive Responses, and Campania Salute Network-StayOnDiur. We validated   a polymorphism in CSMD1 and UGGT2. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reports two  plausible loci associated with SBP response to hydrochlorothiazide: TET2, an  aldosterone-responsive mediator of alphaENaC gene transcription; and CSMD1,  previously described as associated with hypertension in a case-control study."|"essential,response,antihypertensive,hypertensive,hydrochlorothiazide"|"essential,hydrochlorothiazide,hypertensive,response,antihypertensive" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between beta1-adrenergic receptor  (ADRB1) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene polymorphisms and beta-blocker  treatment outcomes in patients with hypertension. METHODS: Chinese patients with   essential hypertension were treated with the beta-blocker metoprolol and followed  up for 12 weeks. xTAG(R) liquid-chip technology was used for CYP2D6 100 C > T and  ADRB1 1165G > C genotyping. Associations between gene polymorphisms and  antihypertensive therapy outcomes were assessed by generalized linear model  fitting. A decrease of >/= 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure indicated an  effective treatment outcome. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were included in the  study. Mutant allele frequencies of 61.29% and 58.60% were obtained for ADRB1 and  CYP2D6, respectively. There was no significant interaction between the effects of  ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on treatment outcome. Patients homozygous for  the mutant ADRB1 genotype (CC) had better treatment outcomes than those  heterozygous for the mutation (GC). Interestingly, beta-blocker treatment  duration was an independent factor associated with treatment outcome.  CONCLUSIONS: The ADRB1 1165G > C gene polymorphism and beta-blocker treatment  duration are independent factors associated with beta-blocker treatment outcome.   These findings suggest that the selection of antihypertensive therapy should take  into consideration the patient's genotype."|"treatment,adrb1,blocker,beta,outcome"|"treatment,adrb1,beta,blocker,cyp2d6" 
"AB  - We examined an association between ghrelin, including its major isoforms,  interleukin-6 (IL-6), body mass index (BMI), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in   male overweight patients with essential hypertension. Twenty hypertensive male  patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension (EH) before starting drug  treatment and 22 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Fasting  total plasma ghrelin (TGhr), acyl ghrelin (AGhr), des-acyl ghrelin (DGhr) and  IL-6 were determined and correlations between studied parameters were calculated.  We found significantly lower total plasma ghrelin and higher plasma IL-6 in  hypertensives when compared with the control. In patients with hypertension the  negative correlations were found: between TGhr and BMI, DGhr and BMI, TGhr and  MAP, and between DGhr and MAP. IL-6 positively correlated with BMI and MAP in  hypertensive subjects. No correlations between all forms of ghrelin and IL-6 were  noted. The changes in plasma ghrelin and IL-6 contribute independently to the  elevated blood pressure in essential hypertension. Negative correlation of DGhr  and MAP may suggest its hemodynamic involvement in regulation of blood pressure."|"il,ghrelin,hypertension,map,plasma"|"ghrelin,il,map,bmi,dghr" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The three branched amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and   two aromatic amino acids (tyrosine and phenylalanine) have been associated with  many adverse metabolic pathways, including diabetes. However, these associations   have been identified primarily in otherwise healthy Caucasian populations. We  aimed to investigate the association of this five-amino-acid signature with  metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in a hypertensive cohort of  Caucasian and African Americans. METHODS: We analyzed data from the  Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) studies PEAR and   PEAR2 conducted between 2005 and 2014. Subjects were enrolled at the University  of Florida (Gainesville, FL), Emory University (Atlanta, GA), and Mayo Clinic  (Rochester, MN). A total of 898 patients with essential hypertension were  included in this study. Presence of metabolic syndrome and IFG at baseline were  determined on the basis of measurements of demographic and biochemical data.  Levels of the five amino acids were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem  mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: With a multiple logistic regression model,  we found that all five amino acids were significantly associated with metabolic  syndrome in both Caucasian and African Americans. IFG and the five amino acids  were associated in the Caucasian Americans. Only valine was significantly  associated with IFG in African Americans. CONCLUSION: In both Caucasian and  African Americans with uncomplicated hypertension, plasma levels of the  five-amino-acid signature are associated with metabolic syndrome. Additionally,  in Caucasians we have confirmed the five-amino-acid signature was associated with  IFG."|"amino,five,metabolic,acids,caucasian"|"amino,associated,acids,americans,caucasian" 
"AB  - Numerous studies have evaluated the association between the angiotensinogen (AGT)  G-217A gene polymorphism and essential hypertension risk. However, the results  have been inconsistent. We examined whether the AGT G-217A gene polymorphism  confers essential hypertension risk by conducting a meta-analysis. We conducted a  literature search of the Google Scholar, PubMed, and China National Knowledge  Infrastructure databases for relevant studies that examined the G-217A  polymorphism and risk of essential hypertension. Statistical analyses were  carried out using Stata 12.0 to combine all relevant studies. Crude odds ratios  (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to estimate the  strength of this association. A total of 2017 patients with psoriasis and 1708  controls from 7 comparative studies were included in this meta-analysis. We found  a significant association between the AGT G-217A gene polymorphism and the risk  of essential hypertension (AA vs GG: OR = 2.52, 95%CI = 1.68-3.78; AA vs GA: OR =  2.26, 95%CI = 1.48-3.45; dominant model: OR = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.26-0.57; recessive   model: OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.03-1.39). Further stratified analyses were conducted   by ethnicity and sample size and produced similar results. No evidence of  publication bias was found. This meta-analysis confirms that the AGT G-217A gene   polymorphism is associated with essential hypertension susceptibility.

However, its effect on the  cardiovascular system remains unknown. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 47 PA  patients including 11 PA patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR) > 130 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (group 1), and 36 PA patients with eGFR 90-110  ml/min per 1.73 m2 (group 2). Fourteen essential hypertension (EH) patients with   eGFR 90-110 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were included as the control group (group 3).  Echocardiography including left ventricular mass index (LVMI) measurement and  tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) was performed. Predicted left ventricular mass (LVM)  was calculated. Inappropriate LVM was defined as an excess of > 35% from the  predicted value. RESULTS: The value of LVMI decreased significantly in order from  groups 1 to 3 (group 1>2>3). While group 2 had a significantly higher percentage   of inappropriate LVM than group 3, the percentage of inappropriate LVM were  comparable in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 had a higher mitral E velocity, E/A ratio  than that of group 2. In the TDI study, the E/E' ratio also decreased  significantly in order from groups 1 to 3 (group 1>2>3). Group 2 had lower E'  than that of group 3, although the E' of group 1 and 2 were comparable.  CONCLUSIONS: Although PA patients with glomerular hyperfiltration were associated  with higher LVMI, higher mitral E velocity, higher E/E' ratio, they had  comparable E' with PA patients with normal GFR. This phenomenon may be explained   by higher intravascular volume in this patient group."|"group,patients,pa,higher,lvmi"|"group,patients,higher,pa,lvm" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study objective was assessing patient adherence to a fixed-dose  combination (FDC) of bisoprolol and amlodipine in daily practice in patients who   had been switched from the free to the fixed-dose combination prior to  recruitment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The non-investigational study was carried out   in Poland. Patients over 18 years of age with essential hypertension were  recruited if they had already been switched from a free combination to the FDC at  least 4 weeks prior to recruitment. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy,  lactation, any contraindication to the FDC, and other antihypertensive treatment.  Adherence was measured by tablet count (tablets taken divided by tablets  prescribed, times 100) and defined as follows: excellent >90%, good 76-90%,  moderate 51-75%, bad </=50%. Other patient data, clinical findings and laboratory  values were recorded upon availability at study start, after 3 months (voluntary)  and after 6 months. RESULTS: Data of 4288 patients (mean age: 59 years; gender:  50% each) were documented. The average daily doses of the FDC were 5.8 mg  bisoprolol and 6.4 mg amlodipine. These doses differ only slightly from those of   the free combination. After 3 months' treatment with the FDC, a dose increase was  carried out in 113 patients for bisoprolol and in 126 for amlodipine. After 6  months of FDC treatment, 82% of the participants of the study showed excellent  adherence and for a further 15% the adherence could be considered good. This  strong adherence may have led to the observed reduction in systolic and diastolic  blood pressure of 11% (Cohen's D efficient size 1.23). In addition, pulse  pressure decreased from 58.8 mm to 52.2 mm. Also in diabetic patients (21% of the  cohort), further reduction of systolic blood pressure values could be achieved  (mean before 150 mm, after 133), wherein the initial differences compared to  patients without diabetes had disappeared. The pulse rate also changed from 75  b/min to 68 b/min under the FDC. CONCLUSION: These study results clearly show  that the FDC leads to excellent patient adherence and therefore may result in  better blood pressure control. Blood pressure control is crucial in the risk  reduction of cardiovascular events. The key limitation of this study is that the   study design does not allow a direct comparison of patient adherence under the  free and the fixed-dose combination."|"study,fdc,adherence,patients,pressure"|"fdc,adherence,study,patients,combination" 
"AB  - This study assessed the antihypertensive efficacy of a triple combination,  fixed-dose therapy of losartan 50 mg (L50)/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg  (H12.5)/amlodipine 5 mg (A5) versus co-administration of L50 plus A5 (L50+A5) in   Japanese subjects with uncontrolled essential hypertension. Initially, all  subjects received single-blind treatment with L50+A5 for 8 weeks. Subjects whose   blood pressure (BP) remained stable within pre-specified limits during the last 4  weeks of L50+A5 administration were randomized (n =3 27) to double-blind  treatment with L50/H12.5/A5 or L50+A5 for 8 weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy  endpoints were mean change from baseline to Week 8 in trough diastolic BP (DBP)  and trough systolic BP (SBP), respectively. Safety was assessed throughout the  study. The treatment difference for L50/H12.5/A5 versus L50+A5 in mean change  from baseline in DBP at Week 8 was -1.1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.7,  0.6; P = 0.205). However, the treatment difference in mean change from baseline  in SBP at Week 8 was -3.2 mm Hg (95% CI: -5.7, -0.8; P=0.011). A chance imbalance  in the change in DBP before randomization between groups was identified in a  post-hoc analysis as a major reason for the smaller-than-expected difference in  DBP between groups. The overall safety profile was generally similar between  groups. In conclusion, treatment with L50/H12.5/A5 for 8 weeks did not  demonstrate a significant difference in DBP reduction, but demonstrated a  nominally significant difference in SBP reduction, compared with L50+A5.  L50/H12.5/A5 was well tolerated. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01302691.).  of Medicine, Suita, Japan."|"a5,l50,dbp,difference,sbp"|"a5,l50,dbp,difference,h12" 
"AB  - Literature remains scarce on the impact of antiretroviral medications on  hypertension in the HIV population. We used the South Carolina Medicaid database   linked with the enhanced HIV/AIDS system surveillance database for 1994-2011 to  evaluate incident hypertension and the impact of combination antiretroviral  therapy (cART) in HIV/AIDS population compared with a propensity- matched non-HIV  control group. Multivariable, time-dependent survival analysis suggested no  significant difference in incidence of hypertension between the HIV group and the  non-HIV control group. However, subgroup analysis suggested that among the  HIV-infected group, months of exposure to both non-nucleoside reverse  transcriptase inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval,  1.3-1.75) and protease inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence  interval, 1.11-1.44) were associated with an increased risk of incident  hypertension after adjusting for traditional demographic and metabolic risk  factors. In people with HIV/AIDS, prolonged exposure to both protease  inhibitor-based and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based cART may  increase the risk of incident hypertension."|"hiv,hypertension,group,aids,non"|"hiv,hypertension,group,non,aids" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a chronic illness associated with high morbidity and   mortality. Once hypertension is diagnosed, starting antihypertensive therapy on a  long-term basis along with regular follow up is important. Standardizing  treatment guidelines and conducting drug utilization studies at regular intervals  help physicians to prescribe drugs rationally. The present study was conducted to  analyze the prescription patterns of antihypertensive drugs in a tertiary care  referral hospital in Malabar region, Kerala, India. METHODS: The study was  conducted at the General Medicine and Cardiology Department involving the  in-patients. Patients suffering from essential hypertension with or without other  co-morbidities were included in the study. The frequency and proportion of  prescribing different groups of antihypertensive drugs as monotherapy or  combination therapy, and prescription of fixed drug combinations (FDCs) were  analyzed. A total of 200 hypertensive patients were included in the study.  Patient data were collected from in-patient's case sheets and direct interviews  with the patients and their observers. RESULTS: The majority of the patients were  females with 56%, whereas the males comprised 44%, with most of the patients  suffering from stage-II hypertension. The study revealed that a high proportion  of the hypertensive patients had co-morbid diabetes mellitus. The most commonly  prescribed class of antihypertensive drugs was angiotensin receptor blockers,  followed by calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers. With regard to patient  therapy, 32.0% received monotherapy, whereas 68.0% received combination therapy,   16% of which received FDCs. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that clinical  pharmacists can play a key role in promoting rational prescription and improving   adherence to medication."|"study,patients,drugs,antihypertensive,hypertension"|"patients,study,antihypertensive,drugs,hypertension" 
"AB  - The prevalence of essential hypertension (EH) among preterm children is unknown.   The authors evaluated consecutive children with a diagnosis of hypertension and  prematurity (gestational age <37 weeks) in a tertiary pediatric hypertension  clinic and identified 36 preterm hypertensive children. Among these preterm  children, 23 were diagnosed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; infantile)  and 13 were diagnosed at an older age (childhood). When compared with patients  with a childhood diagnosis, patients with an infantile diagnosis had a  significantly lower gestational age, longer duration of hospitalization in the  NICU, and a higher incidence of perinatal risk factors for hypertension. None  with infantile diagnosis had EH, whereas 46% with childhood diagnosis had EH.  Among premature children, systemic hypertension was either diagnosed in infancy  or in childhood, with each age at diagnosis having unique risk factors and  clinical course. Although 83% of preterm children had secondary hypertension, EH   was diagnosed in 17% and was only seen in those diagnosed beyond infancy."|"hypertension,diagnosis,age,diagnosed,children"|"children,diagnosis,hypertension,diagnosed,age" 
"AB  - Systemic hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases.  Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) with recurrent apnea is a major risk factor for   developing essential hypertension. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a  hallmark manifestation of recurrent apnea. Rodent models patterned after the O2  profiles seen with SDB patients showed that CIH is the major stimulus for causing  systemic hypertension. This article reviews the physiological and molecular basis  of CIH-induced hypertension. Physiological studies have identified that augmented  carotid body chemosensory reflex and the resulting increase in sympathetic nerve   activity are major contributors to CIH-induced hypertension. Analysis of  molecular mechanisms revealed that CIH activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1  and suppresses HIF-2-mediated transcription. Dysregulation of HIF-1- and  HIF-2-mediated transcription leads to imbalance of pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant  enzyme gene expression resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)  generation in the chemosensory reflex which is central for developing  hypertension."|"hypertension,cih,major,resulting,chemosensory"|"hypertension,cih,hif,major,apnea" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Prospective studies have found low bilirubin levels were an important  predictive factor of cardiovascular events. However, few have yet investigated  possible association between serum bilirubin level and LVH in essential  hypertension. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship  between serum bilirubin levels with LVH in newly diagnosed hypertension patients.  METHODS: The present study evaluated the relationship between serum total  bilirubin level and left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH) in newly diagnosed  hypertensive patients with a sample size of 344. We divided subjects into LVH  group (n=138) and non-LVH group (n=206). Physical examination, laboratory tests  and echocardiography were conducted. The multivariate logistic regression model  was used to verify the independent association between RDW and LVH. RESULTS: Our   results found that patients with LVH had lower bilirubin levels than non-LVH  ones. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed total bilirubin level  (B=-0.017, P=0.008) was negatively associated with left ventricle mass index  (LVMI) even adjusting for some confounders. The multiples logistic regression  found total bilirubin level was independently related with of LVH, as a  protective factors (OR=0.91, P=0.010). CONCLUSION: As a routine and quick  laboratory examination index, serum bilirubin may be treated as novel marker for   evaluating LVH risk in hypertensive patients. Cohort study with larger sample  size are needed."|"bilirubin,lvh,serum,level,patients"|"lvh,bilirubin,level,patients,serum" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: An increased risk for developing essential hypertension, stroke and  diabetes is associated with single nucleotide gene polymorphisms in renalase, a  newly described secreted flavoprotein with oxidoreductase activity. Gene deletion  causes hypertension, and aggravates acute ischemic kidney (AKI) and cardiac  injury. Independent of its intrinsic enzymatic activities, extracellular renalase  activates MAPK signaling and prevents acute kidney injury (AKI) in wild type (WT)  mice. Therefore, we sought to identity the receptor for extracellular renalase.  METHODS AND RESULTS: RP-220 is a previously identified, 20 amino acids long  renalase peptide that is devoid of any intrinsic enzymatic activity, but it is  equally effective as full-length recombinant renalase at protecting against toxic  and ischemic injury. Using biotin transfer studies with RP-220 in the human  proximal tubular cell line HK-2 and protein identification by mass spectrometry,   we identified PMCA4b as a renalase binding protein. This previously characterized  plasma membrane ATPase is involved in cell signaling and cardiac hypertrophy.  Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunolocalization confirmed protein-protein  interaction between endogenous renalase and PMCA4b. Down-regulation of endogenous  PMCA4b expression by siRNA transfection, or inhibition of its enzymatic activity   by the specific peptide inhibitor caloxin1b each abrogated RP-220 dependent MAPK   signaling and cytoprotection. In control studies, these maneuvers had no effect  on epidermal growth factor mediated signaling, confirming specificity of the  interaction between PMCA4b and renalase. CONCLUSIONS: PMCA4b functions as a  renalase receptor, and a key mediator of renalase dependent MAPK signaling."|"renalase,signaling,pmca4b,protein,activity"|"renalase,pmca4b,signaling,protein,220" 
"AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) may be involved in blood pressure   regulation by inactivation of angiotensin II and generation of bradykinin. Our  previous study with cDNA microarray indicated that the expression of ERAP1 is  down-regulated in essential hypertension (EH) patients. Since the 3'untranslated   region (3'UTR) is known to play an important role in the post-transcriptional  regulation by influencing the stability and translation process of mRNA, the  present study aims to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  3'UTR of ERAP1 gene in a case-control study among the Northeastern Han Chinese  through PCR-sequencing, and analyze the association with EH. Our results further   verified the lower expression level of ERAP1 in the peripheral blood cells in  patients with EH (917.12+/-517.57 vs. 1506.59+/-1214.09pg/mL, P=0.011). Four  SNPs, 3'UTR-761G>A, 3'UTR-787C>T, 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G, were  identified in the 3'UTR of ERAP1. 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G were in almost   complete linkage disequilibrium. Association analysis showed that the genotypic  and allelic frequencies of 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G were significantly  different between EH and the control groups. Logistic regression and haplotypic  analysis indicated that alleles of E20-1037C and E20-1084G as well as haplotype  of C-G were the risk factors of EH (P<0.05). Subgroup analysis performed by age  suggested that the frequencies of genotype and allele of 3'UTR-1008A>C and  3'UTR-1055A>G as well as the haplotypes C-G and A-A were significantly different   between EH and the control in the younger group (<50), but not in the older group  (>/=50). Younger population with the 3'UTR-1008CC and/or 3'UTR-1055GG genotypes  also tended to have higher blood pressure, especially the diastolic blood  pressure. In conclusion, the 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G polymorphisms of  ERAP1 gene were associated with EH, especially in the younger population, and the  haplotype C-G could be the independent marker of EH."|"utr,eh,erap1,blood,study"|"utr,eh,erap1,1008a,1055a" 
"AB  - We investigated the association between rs751141 polymorphisms in the EPHX2 gene   and essential hypertension in Uygur, Kazakh, and Han subjects in Xinjiang, China.  A total of 302 essential hypertensive patients in Uygur, 267 in Kazakh, and 368  in Han, as well as 323 normotensive controls in Uygur, 284 in Kazakh, and 348 in   Han were enrolled in this study. The TaqMan assay was used to detect the rs751141  G/A gene polymorphism in EPHX2. The rs751141 G/A genotype frequencies for the  GA+AA genotypes were 40.2% in essential hypertensive subjects and 52.0% in  control subjects in the Han population. The frequencies were significantly  different between the 2 Han groups (P < 0.01). The rs751141G/A gene polymorphism   showed no significant difference between essential hypertensive patients and  normotensive controls in Kazakh and Uygur (all P > 0.05). Essential hypertension   in Xinjiang was associated with the rs751141 G/A allele gene polymorphism in  EPHX2 in Han subjects but not in Kazakh and Uygur subjects. The rs751141 allele  gene polymorphism may be an independent protective factor against essential  hypertension in the Han population."|"essential,han,gene,rs751141,polymorphism"|"han,essential,gene,kazakh,rs751141" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Regulators of G-protein signaling protein 2 (RGS2) play an  irreplaceable role in the control of normal blood pressure (BP). One RGS2 (-391,   C>G) genetic variation markedly changes its mRNA expression levels. This study  explored the relationship between this genetic variation and the responses to  antihypertensive drugs in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. METHODS:   Genetic variations of RGS2 were successfully identified in 367 specimens using  polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)  assays. All patients were treated with conventional doses of antihypertensives  after a 2-week run-in period and followed-up according to our protocol. A general  linear model multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the data  analysis. RESULTS: A significant difference in the mean systolic BP change was  observed between RGS2 (-391, C>G) CC/CG (n = 82) and GG (n = 38) genotype  carriers (-13.6 vs. -19.9 mmHg, P = 0.043) who were treated with candesartan,  irbesartan or imidapril at the end of 6 weeks. In addition, the patients' BP  responses to alpha,beta-adrenergic receptor blockers exhibited an age-specific  association with the RGS2 (-391, C>G) genetic variation at the end of 4 weeks.  CONCLUSION: The RGS2 (-391, C>G) genetic polymorphism may serve as a biomarker to  predict a patient's response to antihypertensive drug therapy, but future studies  need to confirm this."|"rgs2,genetic,bp,patients,variation"|"rgs2,genetic,391,bp,patients" 
"AB  - It is well known that the onset of essential hypertension occurs earlier in men  than women. Numerous studies have shown sex differences in the vasculature,  kidney and sympathetic nervous system contribute to this sex difference in the  development of hypertension. The immune system also contributes to the  development of hypertension; however, sex differences in immune system modulation  of blood pressure (BP) and the development of hypertension has only recently  begun to be explored. Here we review findings on the effect of one's sex on the  immune system and specifically how these effects impact BP and the development of  primary hypertension. We also propose a hypothesis for why mechanisms underlying   inflammation-induced hypertension are sex-specific. These studies underscore the   value of and need for studying both sexes in the basic science exploration of the  pathophysiology of hypertension as well as other diseases."|"hypertension,sex,system,development,immune"|"hypertension,sex,development,immune,bp" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Songling Xuemaikang  Capsule (, SXC) for the treatment of primary hypertension. METHODS: An extensive   search including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM),  Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal  Database (VIP), KoreaMed, Japanese database, and online clinical trial registry  websites was performed up to February 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  regarding SXC for the treatment of primary hypertension were searched without no   language restrictions. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the  Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 5.0, and RevMan 5.0 provided by the Cochrane  Collaboration. RESULT: A total of 17 RCTs involving 1,778 patients were included.  Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between SXC and  antihypertensive agents on systolic blood pressure [mean difference (MD): -0.10  [-4.83, 4.63]; P=0.97] and diastolic blood pressure (MD: 1.00 [-1.16, 3.16];  P=0.36), but SXC combined with antihypertensive drugs was more effective in  lowering systolic blood pressure (MD: -6.17 [-7.86, -4.49]; P<0.00001) and  diastolic blood pressure (MD: -7.24 [-8.62, -5.85]; P<0.00001) compared with the   antihypertensive drugs alone. CONCLUSIONS: SXC used alone or combined with  antihypertensive drugs appear to be an effective treatment for lowering elevated   blood pressure and improving symptoms in patients with primary hypertension.  However, the conclusion cannot be drawn definitely due to the poor quality of the  included studies. There is still an urgent need for well-designed, long-term  studies to address the benefits of SXC for treating primary hypertension."|"sxc,cochrane,primary,hypertension,treatment"|"sxc,blood,pressure,antihypertensive,cochrane" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Daily sessions of slow-breathing (6 breaths/min) significantly reduced  24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in patients with mild hypertension and this   effect persisted at least 6 months after the interruption of sessions. The  sequence of changes induced by slow-breathing (SB) daily sessions on the  modulation of ambulatory blood pressure, renal resistive index, heart rate  variability (HRV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was thus investigated in a  randomized, controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients (30-75  years, grade I essential hypertension), untreated with antihypertensive drugs,  were randomized to daily sessions (30 min) of music-guided SB (<10 breaths/min)  (intervention, n = 24) or simple relaxation (control, n = 13). Office and  ambulatory blood pressure monitoring renal Doppler ultrasound, assessment of BRS   (sequence method and spectral analysis), and HRV (spectral power in the high- and  low-frequency bands) were performed at baseline, and after 1, 4, and 8 weeks.  Mixed model analysis was conducted on derived variables given by the difference  between each measurement and the baseline value within subjects. RESULTS: After 1  week, the intervention enhanced the parasympathetic modulation (high-frequency  power; at least p < 0.05 vs both control and baseline) and reduced renal vascular  resistance (p < 0.05 for both comparisons); after 1 month, the enhancement of BRS  (p < 0.05 for both comparisons at both methods) paralleled a significant  reduction in 24 h ABP (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). INTERPRETATION: Repeated  daily session of music-guided SB increased parasympathetic modulation and  decreased renal resistive index early in the study. These changes were being  followed by a positive modulation of BRS and blood pressure reduction."|"brs,renal,modulation,baseline,sessions"|"05,blood,brs,daily,modulation" 
"AB  - Antiplatelet agents represent a cornerstone in the management of patients at  increased cardiovascular risk. Essential hypertension is considered a major  public health problem leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality. The majority of patients with essential hypertension exhibit also  additional cardiovascular risk factors and present with increased platelet  activation. Despite recent innovations in the field of antiplatelet treatment and  the introduction of novel agents, the role of antiplatelet treatment in patients   with essential hypertension remains understudied. This review aims to shed light   on novel experimental and clinical data in the evolving field of antiplatelet  treatment in essential hypertension. In particular, recent data regarding  aspirin, clopidogrel, novel P2Y12 inhibitors, and other agents with potential  antiplatelet effects are critically reviewed."|"antiplatelet,essential,hypertension,novel,patients"|"antiplatelet,essential,hypertension,agents,cardiovascular" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) is an enzyme that  oxidizes acetaldehyde into acetic acid during alcohol metabolism. Many studies  indicate that the rs671 GG genotype in the ALDH2 gene may play a critical role in  increasing the risk of essential hypertension (EH) associated with alcohol  consumption, which predominantly occurs in men. However, the literature is  inconclusive in this regard. This meta-analysis aims to derive a more precise  estimation of the relationship between the rs671 polymorphism and EH for both  male and female drinkers and nondrinkers. METHODS: Ten cohort and case-control  studies were included in the analysis with a total of 12,161 subjects; 7,062  patients and 5,099 healthy controls. RESULTS: Our results show that the rs671 GG   genotype was associated with an increased risk of EH compared with the AG+AA  genotype (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI = 1.17-1.37, p < 0.00001). When comparing male and  female subjects, only among male individuals was a higher risk of EH found in the  GG genotype compared with the AG+ AA genotype (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI = 1.40-1.80, p   < 0.00001). By contrast, among female subjects, the risk of EH in the rs671 GG  genotype did not differ from that detected in the AA + GG genotype. The  proportion of patients with EH was significantly higher for the GG genotype  carriers than for the AG+AA genotype carriers, both in the subset of drinkers (OR  = 1.51, 95 % CI = 1.23-1.86, p < 0.0001) and in that of nondrinkers (OR = 1.22,  95 % CI = 1.01-1.47, p = 0.03). In addition, among carriers of the GG genotype,  the risk of EH among the drinkers was similar to that found in the nondrinkers'  subset (OR = 1.12, 95 %CI = 0.89-1.41, p = 0.34). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis  demonstrates that the rs671 GG genotype increases the risks of EH, especially in   men, and is independent of alcohol consumption."|"eh,genotype,gg,rs671,risk"|"genotype,eh,gg,95,ci" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The A561C polymorphism of the E-selectin gene (SELE) has been  reported to be associated with essential hypertension (EH) in several studies;  however, results among these studies were inconsistent. Here, we conducted a  meta-analysis to explore the association of the A561C polymorphism with EH.  METHODS: Publications were retrieved through searching PubMed, Web of Science,  the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biological Medicine,  and the Wanfang database. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI)  were calculated to estimate the strength of association of A561C with EH.  Subgroup analysis was also performed to assess ethnic discrepancies. A total of  seven studies comprising 2,127 EH patients and 2,078 controls were analyzed.  RESULTS: In the dominant model analysis, we found significant associations  between the A561C polymorphism and EH in all subjects (CC+AC vs. AA, OR = 1.96,  95 %CI 1.57-2.44, P heterogeneity = 0.381), in a Han Chinese subgroup (CC+AC vs.   AA, OR = 2.38, 95 %CI 1.73-3.29, P heterogeneity = 0.269), and in non-Han Chinese  minorities (CC+AC vs. AA, OR = 1.62, 95 %CI 1.19-2.21, P heterogeneity = 0.84).  CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that C allele carriers of the SELE gene  polymorphism (A561C) might be predisposed to EH in the Chinese population.  Further investigations in other ethnic populations should be conducted to verify   these findings."|"eh,a561c,polymorphism,analysis,studies"|"eh,a561c,95,ci,polymorphism" 
"AB  - The potential effects of the interactions between DNA methylation (CpG1 and  CpG2-5 methylation levels) of the alpha-adducin (ADD1) gene promoter and ADD1  tagSNPs (tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms) or the environmental factors on  essential hypertension (EH) risk have not been clarified. Thus, we performed an  age- and gender-matched case-control study to investigate the association between  ADD1 tagSNPs and EH. A total of 1020 subjects with EH and 1020 normotensive  subjects were genotyped by melting temperature shift technology. Logistic  regression was used to assess the associations of ADD1 tagSNPs, environmental  factors and EH. The generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR)  method was applied to explore the potential interactions. Under additive,  dominant and recessive models, no significant associations were evidenced between  EH and rs3755885, rs2071694, rs4963 or rs3775067 with the complete data set or  the gender-stratified analysis after adjusting for triglycerides, body mass index  and alcohol consumption. However, we observed a significant association between  rs4961 and EH under the dominant model after Bonferroni correction when adjusting  for confounding factors in the entire sample (odds ratio (OR)=0.64, 95%  confidence interval (CI)=0.50-0.83, P=0.001). In GMDR, the two-factor interaction  model of alcohol consumption and DNA methylation (CpG1 methylation) was the best   model, with a maximum cross-validation consistency of 9/10 and testing balance  accuracy of 0.63 (P=0.01). Our results indicate that the SNP rs4961 has a  protective role in the development of EH.

To investigate whether nNOS signaling is  dysfunctional in essential hypertension, forearm blood flow responses to mental  stress were examined in 88 subjects: 48 with essential hypertension (42+/-14  years; blood pressure, 141+/-17/85+/-15 mm Hg; mean+/-SD) and 40 normotensive  controls (38+/-14 years; 117+/-13/74+/-9 mm Hg). A subsample of 34 subjects (17  hypertensive) participated in a single blind 2-phase crossover study, in which  placebo or sildenafil 50 mg PO was administered before an intrabrachial artery  infusion of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC, 0.05,  0.1, and 0.2 mumol/min) at rest and during mental stress. In a further subsample   (n=21) with an impaired blood flow response to mental stress, responses were  measured in the presence and absence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist  phentolamine. The blood flow response to mental stress was impaired in  hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects (37+/-7% versus 70+/-8% increase  over baseline; P<0.001). SMTC blunted responses to mental stress in normotensive   but not in hypertensive subjects (reduction of 40+/-11% versus 3.0+/-14%,  respectively, P=0.01, between groups). Sildenafil reduced the blood flow response  to stress in normotensive subjects from 89+/-14% to 43+/-14% (P<0.03) but had no   significant effect in hypertensive subjects. Phentolamine augmented impaired  blood flow responses to mental stress from 39+/-8% to 67+/-13% (P<0.02).  Essential hypertension is associated with impaired mental stress-induced  nNOS-mediated vasodilator responses; this may relate to increased sympathetic  outflow in hypertension. nNOS dysfunction may impair vascular homeostasis in  essential hypertension and contribute to stress-induced cardiovascular events."|"stress,nnos,mental,blood,hypertension"|"stress,mental,blood,flow,subjects" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is one of the most common disorders that underpin  significant morbidity and mortality; however, underlying mechanisms remain  elusive that either dictate the actions of individual quantitative trait loci  (QTLs) or engineer the overall genetic architecture from them. Recent  experimental evidence has unveiled that the genetic architecture determining  blood pressure (BP) is assembled from QTL-building blocks by epistasis into  regulatory hierarchies. BP, a polygenic and quantitative trait, is homeostasized   via pathways participated by Mendelian constituents that operate distantly from  end-phase physiological genes. Epistasis genetics performed in the current  article has mechanistically unravelled the order and regulatory relationships  between certain BP QTLs, and is the first study ever conducted in a mammalian  system in analysing a complex trait. The elucidation of the sequence of event and  regulatory hierarchies of QTL actions in these pathways will facilitate  mechanism-based diagnoses and cause-driven treatments for essential hypertension."|"bp,trait,regulatory,actions,pathways"|"bp,regulatory,trait,actions,architecture" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the metabolite profiles of venous effluent from both  kidneys of individuals with unilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis  (ARAS) in order to directly examine how impaired renal blood flow impacts  small-molecule handling in humans. METHODS: We applied liquid chromatography-mass  spectrometry based metabolite profiling to venous plasma obtained from the  stenotic (STK) and contralateral (CLK) kidneys of ARAS patients (n = 16), and  both the kidneys of essential hypertensive controls (n = 11). Study samples were   acquired during a 3-day protocol that included iothalamate clearance  measurements, radiographic kidney phenotyping (Duplex ultrasound, multidetector  computed tomography, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent MRI), and controlled sodium  and caloric intake and antihypertensive treatment. RESULTS: Partial least  squares-discriminant analysis demonstrated clear separation of essential  hypertensive kidney metabolite profiles versus STK and CLK metabolite profiles,  but no separation between metabolite profiles of STK and CLK samples. All of the   discriminating metabolites were similarly elevated in the STK and CLK samples,  likely reflecting the lower glomerular filtration rate in the ARAS versus  essential hypertensive individuals (mean 66.1 versus 89.2 ml/min per 1.73 m). In   a paired analysis within the ARAS group, no metabolite was significantly altered   in STK compared with CLK samples; notably, creatinine was the same in STK and CLK  samples (STK/CLK ratio = 1.0, P = 0.9). Results were unchanged in an examination   of ARAS patients in the bottom half of renal tissue perfusion or oxygenation.  CONCLUSION: Metabolite profiling does not differentiate venous effluent from STKs  or CLKs in individuals with unilateral ARAS, despite the measurable loss of  kidney volume and blood flow on the affected side. These findings are consistent   with the kidney's ability to adapt to ARAS to maintain a range of metabolic  functions."|"aras,metabolite,kidney,stk,clk"|"aras,clk,metabolite,stk,samples" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among  patients with arterial hypertension, and indirectly, the crucial impact of  adopting screening for diabetes as a standard procedure for all patients  diagnosed with arterial hypertension. MATERIALS & METHODS: This cross-sectional  study was performed on a sample of hypertensive patients recruited from three  different university hospitals in Lebanon. Blood pressure and glycemic blood  measurements were determined in all subjects. In addition, a complete clinical  history and physical exam were performed. Data was entered and analyzed using  SPSS 19.0. Frequencies for the different variables were calculated, and the  chi-square and independent sample t-tests were conducted. RESULTS: This study  included 294 patients. Prevalence of diabetes was 27%, and 23% of diabetic  patients were newly diagnosed. More than half of the subjects suffering from DM  had uncontrolled blood pressure, contrasted with only one third of the  non-diabetic subjects with uncontrolled hypertension. CONCLUSION: The prevalence   of DM in patients with essential hypertension was more than double that of the  general population. Therefore, major recommendations would be to adopt strictly  the diabetes screening requirements and aggressive management among hypertensive   patients to minimize both the health and cost burdens associated with undetected   DM."|"patients,diabetes,hypertension,dm,subjects"|"patients,diabetes,dm,hypertension,blood" 
"AB  - Changing living conditions, which lead to physical inactivity and obesity, are  probably the main reason for the establishment of risk factors for cardiovascular  diseases in children and adolescents. In the past those risk factors were  typically seen only in the elderly. On long-term, the elevated body-mass-index is  a very important risk factor for primary arterial hypertension in children and  adolescents, because it is responsible for both structural and functional changes  in the cardiovascular system. Regular screening for these target organ damages is  necessary. However, the role of newer methods has still to be proven in current  research. The primary therapeutical options for this group are life style  interventions like body weight control and physical activity. Children and  adolescents with arterial hypertension persisting despite life style  interventions should receive medication early, in order to prevent persistent  target organ damage. Drug therapy should start as mono therapy--depending on  patient profile--with one ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist,  calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker. If blood pressure cannot be reduced into  the target area by mono therapy, combination therapy with different mechanisms  should be started. Forms of secondary arterial hypertension have to be treated  according to the primary disease."|"target,risk,therapy,primary,hypertension"|"therapy,adolescents,arterial,children,hypertension" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the cardiovascular structure and function in children with  confirmed primary hypertension, and to explore the impact of hypertension and  related risk factors on cardiovascular structure and function of children.  METHODS: Parameters related to cardiac structure, vascular structure and function  were measured in 213 hypertensive children, who were confirmed upon repeated  measurements on separate occasions. A total of 197 healthy children were  recruited as controls. RESULTS: 1) In hypertensive children, left ventricular  end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESd),  left ventricular mass (LVM), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular  posterior wall thickness (LVPT) and interventricular septal thickness (IVST) were  all significantly higher than their counterparts (P < 0.05). No statistical  differences were found in carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), relative wall  thickness (RWT) and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV). 2) Compared with  controls, LVEDd, LVESd, LVM, LVMI were all significantly higher in hypertensive  children (P < 0.05), regardless of age group or weight-status. No statistical  differences were found in ccIMT and RWT, while ba-PWV was statistically higher in  controls among children aged 6-12 years. 3) Data from multiple linear regression   analysis noticed that LVMI was associated with age, sex, BMI and hypertension  while RWT was associated with age and BMI. CONCLUSION: In children with primary  hypertension, changes of vascular structure and function were not shown but left   ventricular remodeling and early changes of function had been developed in  children under 12 years old."|"children,function,ventricular,left,thickness"|"children,left,ventricular,function,structure" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between urinary microalbumin-to-creatinine   ratio (ACR) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in hypertensive  patients. METHODS: A total of 877 primary hypertension patients were enrolled in   this trial from September 2009 to December 2012, and were randomly recruited and   patients were divided into normal ACR group (ACR < 30 mg/g, n = 723),  micro-albuminuria group (30 mg/g </= ACR < 300 mg/g, n = 136) and  macro-albuminuria group (ACR >/= 300 mg/g, n = 18). baPWV was measure by  automatic pulse wave velocity measuring system. RESULTS: The baPWV values in  patients of micro-albuminuria group and macro-albuminuria group were  significantly higher than in the normal ACR group (all P < 0.05). The baPWV value  of macro-albuminuria group was significantly higher than in the micro-albuminuria  group (P < 0.05). Linear correlation analysis revealed that ACR was positively  correlated with baPWV (r = 0.413, P < 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis   showed that ACR independently correlated with baPWV in patients with primary  hypertension (beta = 0.29, R(2) = 0.112, P < 0.01) after adjusting for age, sex,   body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood  glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein and  triglyceride. Using ACR < 30 mg/g and ACR >/= 30 mg/g as dichotomous variable,  binary logistic regression analysis showed that ACR >/= 30 mg/g was also a risk  factor of the ascending baPWV in primary hypertension patients (OR: 1.73, 95% CI:  1.62-2.98) after adjusting the traditional cardiovascular risk factors.  CONCLUSION: ACR is positively correlated to baPWV in primary hypertension  patients, and the ascending baPWV is a risk factor of early renal dysfunction in   primary hypertension patients."|"acr,bapwv,patients,mg,hypertension"|"acr,bapwv,group,patients,mg" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between homocysteine level and  prethrombotic status and long-term thromboembolic events in patients with primary  hypertension. METHODS: Results between 110 hypertensive patients with elevated  homocysteine (HCY) level were compared with 110 hypertensive patients with normal  HCY level which were enrolled from October 2003 to November 2009. Fibrinogen  (FIB), viscosity, thrombomodulin (TM), granule membrane protein (GMP-140),  prethrombin F1+2 fragment (F1+2), D-dimer fragment (D-Dimer) and antithrombin III  (AT-III) were measured and correlated to HCY and prethrombotic state. The  endpoints of the study were arterial and venous thromboembolic events. The  variables linked with arterial and venous thromboembolic events were included in   Cox proportional hazard models. The event-free survival was illustrated with  Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared by the Log-rank test. RESULTS: The  patients were followed up for 8-122 months (median follow-up time was 85 months).  Compared with hypertensive patients with normal HCY, the plasma level of TM  ((4.8+/-1.2) microg/L vs. (4.5+/-1.0) microg/L, P = 0.045), GMP-140 ((18.8+/-3.2)  microg/L vs. (17.1+/-4.3) microg/L, P = 0.001), F1+2 ((1.2+/-0.4) nmol/L vs.  (1.0+/-0.6) nmol/L, P = 0.004) were significantly higher while the plasma level  of AT-III ((95.3+/-10.4) % vs. (98.6+/-10.6)%, P = 0.021) was significantly lower  in hypertensive patients with elevated HCY level. FIB, viscosity of plasma and  D-dimer were similar between the two groups. Multiple regression analyses  indicated that HCY level was negatively correlated with AT-III (beta = -0.199, P   = 0.011) and positively correlated with age (beta = 0.217, P = 0.04), female  gender (beta = 5.667, P = 0.001) and TM (beta = 2.341, P = 0.003). Cox  multivariate analysis revealed that age and HCY level were independent prognostic  risk factors of thromboembolic events (OR 1.046, 95% CI 1.013-1.082, OR 1.052,  95% CI 1.027-1.078, respectively) (all P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that  there was a significant difference in the event-free survival between the two  groups (Log-rank test, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with normal HCY  hypertensive patients, the levels of plasma prothrombin activators such as TM,  GMP-140 and F1+2 were significant increased and anti-thrombin factor such as  AT-III was significant decreased in hypertensive patients with elevated HCY. Old   age and high HCY level were independent prognostic risk factors of thromboembolic  events. The event-free survival in hypertensive patients with elevated HCY is  lower than in hypertensive patients with normal HCY level."|"level,hcy,patients,thromboembolic,iii"|"hcy,level,patients,hypertensive,events" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the improvement in the health care industry, the rates of  undetected, untreated, and uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) are still very high,  especially in rural areas of China. The aim of this study was to investigate the   efficacy and efficiency of a guideline-based HTN management (novel therapy) in  population of rural areas of Guangdong Province. METHODS: Totally, 3113 patients   with essential HTN in a rural area of Guangdong Province were enrolled and  assigned to two groups, named traditional (n = 372) and novel therapeutic (n =  2741) groups, respectively. Patients in the traditional group were treated  routinely, and patients in the novel group were treated in a novel model  characterized by regular educational programs for hypertensive populations, close  monitoring of blood pressure in combination with finely tuned antihypertensive  medications, strict implementation of lifestyle modification and improving  medical knowledge and skill of local medical staff efficiently. After 2 years of   follow-up, primary endpoints including magnitude of systolic and diastolic blood   pressures (SBP and DBP) decrease, treated and controlled rates, as well as  secondary endpoints, were evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: Initially, the  treated rate was significantly higher in traditional group than that of novel  group (71.15% vs. 64.99%, P < 0.05), while the controlled rates were comparable  and insignificant difference between baseline BP in both groups (31.07% vs.  26.88%, P > 0.05). Four variables were significantly different, namely smoking  rate, daily vegetable consumption (VC), and serum levels of low-density  lipoprotein-cholesterol and fasting blood glucose between these two groups. After  2 years of follow-up, decreases in SBP and DBP were more prominent in the novel  group (P < 0.001). Treated and controlled rates in both groups were both  increased. Nevertheless, in comparison to the traditional group, controlled rate   increased more significantly in the novel group (64.31% vs. 37.85%, P < 0.001).  Variables indicating lifestyle modification such as high sodium consumption,  percentages of alcohol abuse, daily VC were profoundly improved in the novel  group. CONCLUSIONS: The guideline-based HTN management implemented in the current  study was beneficial for HTN control in rural areas of Guangdong Province."|"novel,groups,htn,group,rates"|"group,novel,groups,htn,treated" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was suggested to be an important  risk factor for hypertensive vascular complications. Previous studies had also  shown that red cell distribution width (RDW) was associated with morbidity and  mortality of cardiovascular disease. However, few have yet investigated possible   association between RDW and LVH. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the  relationship between LVH and RDW levels in hypertensive patients. METHODS:  Physical examination, laboratory tests and echocardiography were conducted in 330  untreated newly diagnosed hypertensive patients attending the cardiology  consultation unit at the Anzhen Hospital of Beijing. The multivariate logistic  regression model was used to verify the independent association between RDW and  LVH. RESULTS: 174 patients without LVH and 156 patients with LVH were rolled in  the study. The patients with LVH had higher mean SBP, albumin to creatinine  ratio, total cholesterol, RDW and fasting glucose compared with non-LVH group.  The mean HDL-cholesterol level was significantly lower in patients with LVH than   patients without LVH. The multiple logistic regression model suggested that  patients with a higher RDW level were more likely to be LVH (OR=2.187, 95%CI:  1.447-3.307, P<0.001). Other predictive factors for LVH were mean SBP, serum  creatinine, glucose level. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves  indicated area under the curve was 0.688(95%CI: 0.635-0.737, P<0.001) with a  cut-off value of 12.9, the RDW predicted LVH status among hypertensive patients  with a sensitivity of 72.4% and a specificity of 60.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The higher  RDW level was observed in the LVH group compared with the non-LVH group. RDW  might be associated with LVH in hypertensive patients. These data highlight the  role of RDW as a predictor of organ damage in essential hypertensive patients."|"lvh,rdw,patients,hypertensive,level"|"lvh,patients,rdw,hypertensive,level" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Occlusive renovascular disease and hypertension may  progress to CKD. Circulating levels of several biomarkers, including fibroblast  growth factor (FGF)-23, Klotho, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator  receptor (suPAR), are altered in patients with CKD, but their role in essential  hypertension (EH) and renovascular hypertension (RVH) remains unclear. DESIGN,  SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Levels of FGF-23, Klotho, suPAR,  plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, tissue factor, and tissue factor pathway  inhibitor (TFI) were measured in the inferior vena cava and renal vein of  hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (n=12) or  age-matched participants with EH (n=12) and relatively preserved renal function.   Single-kidney blood flow was measured to calculate renal release of markers. For   control, peripheral vein levels were measured in healthy volunteers (HVs; n=12).   RESULTS: FGF-23 levels did not differ among the groups, whereas Klotho levels  were lower in participants with RVH and EH than in HVs, and suPAR levels were  elevated in patients with RVH compared with HVs and patients with EH (6.1+/-1.5  versus 4.4+/-1.9 and 3.2+/-1.2 ng/ml, P<0.05). PAI-1 levels were higher in  patients with RVH than in patients with EH, but tissue factor and TFI levels were  not statistically significantly different. After adjustment for GFR, Klotho  levels remained decreased in both RVH and EH, and suPAR and PAI-1 levels remained  elevated in RVH. eGFR correlated inversely with systemic and renal vein suPAR  levels, and directly with systemic Klotho levels. CONCLUSIONS: Klotho levels are   low in hypertensive patients, whereas suPAR and PAI-1 levels are specifically  elevated in RVH, correlating with GFR. Klotho, PAI-1, and suPAR may be markers of  kidney injury in hypertensive patients."|"levels,patients,klotho,supar,renal"|"levels,patients,klotho,rvh,supar" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: Abstract Background: The G894T (rs1799983) polymorphism in  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS/NOS3) gene has been implicated in  susceptibility to essential hypertension (EH) in some studies, but no clear  consensus has been reached in the Chinese population. AIMS: This study aimed to  investigate the association of the G894T polymorphism and EH in Han Chinese.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: First, a case-control study was performed involving 1525  subjects in northern Han Chinese to study the association between G894T variants   and EH and then a meta-analysis was conducted of all available studies in Han  Chinese. A total of 25 studies comprising 13,443 subjects were finally included  in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: The present case-control study failed to show  significant association of G894T variant with EH in northern Han Chinese. The  subsequent meta-analysis showed that this polymorphism might be associated with  EH in Han Chinese (p < 0.001, OR = 1.32), especially in southern Han Chinese (p <  0.001, OR = 1.59), but not in northern Han Chinese (p = 0.12, OR = 1.16). The  meta-regression analysis suggested that the geographic difference of subjects was  related to heterogeneity (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the  G894T polymorphism and hypertension in Han Chinese may be attributed to the  difference in geographic background of subjects. It is necessary to carry out  further research with a large sample size and focusing on gene-environment  interactions."|"chinese,subjects,han,eh,g894t"|"chinese,han,eh,g894t,subjects" 
"AB  - To measure the plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin (ADM),atrial natriuretic  peptide (ANP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and investigate their  pathophysiological functions in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA). Between  June 2006 and December 2012, we recruited 25 patients with untreated PA, 30  patients with untreated low-renin essential hypertension (EH), and 35 healthy  control subjects. The plasma concentrations of ADM, ANP, and BNP were measured in  all the subjects. After 4 weeks of effective antihypertensive therapy with  slow-release nifedipine, the three peptides were measured again in the PA and  low-renin EH subjects. Unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in all  the PA patients; 2 weeks after surgery, the three peptides were measured again.  The PA patients had significantly higher plasma concentrations of ADM, ANP, and  BNP than the low-renin EH and control subjects. The low-renin EH and control  subjects significantly differed in the concentrations of the three peptides  between low-renin EH and control subjects. ADM was the most important peptide  associated with aldosterone or blood pressure in the PA patients. Plasma ADM  concentration was not only correlated with plasma aldosterone concentrations, but  also with systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and plasma ANP and BNP  concentrations in the PA patients. By contrast, ADM concentration was not related  to blood urea nitrogen levels, serum creatinine levels, and glomerular filtration  rates. After antihypertensive treatment, the concentrations of the three peptides  significantly decreased in the low-renin EH patients, but remained unchanged in  the PA subjects. However, these concentrations significantly decreased 2 weeks  after laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the PA subjects. ADM, ANP, and BNP possibly  participate in the mechanisms counteracting further elevation of blood pressure  or plasma volume expansion resulting from aldosterone hypersecretion in PA  patients. An ADM/aldosterone local regulatory mechanism may be involved in  regulating adrenal adenoma functions."|"pa,patients,concentrations,adm,blood"|"pa,patients,adm,concentrations,subjects" 
"AB  - Little is known about the relationship between the circadian BP rhythm and  endothelial function in patients with essential hypertension. Consequently, we  have hypothesized, that hypertensive patients with non-dipper circadian BP  profile have more deteriorated endothelial function, than those with dipper BP  profile. 57 untreated hypertensive patients and 17 normotensive controls were  undergone to the anthropometrical measurements, physical examinations, review of   their medical histories, 24-hour ABPM and vascular doppler-echography with high  resolution ultrasound. Circadian BP profile was not independent from the BP  level; namely, dipper profile was more frequent in normotensives. Independent  from hypertension, dipper patients had significantly higher FMD%. In the whole  study population, FMD showed strong negative correlation with 24-hour SBP, DBP  and PP. Our study confirms the presence of disturbed endothelium-dependent  vasodilatation in AH. Furthermore, our study showed that non-dipper circadian BP   rhythm is associated with the significant impairment of endothelial function.  Consequently, we can suggest that patients with non-dipper circadian BP profile  could be assessed as a high risk group, which might need permanent supervising  for avoiding of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications."|"dipper,bp,circadian,patients,study"|"bp,dipper,circadian,patients,profile" 
"AB  - Adipokines are hormones produced by adipocytes and have been involved in multiple  pathologic pathways, including inflammatory and cardiovascular complications in  essential hypertension. Arterial stiffness is a frequent vascular complication  that represents increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.  Adipokines, such as adiponectin, leptin and resistin, might be implicated in  hypertension, as well as in vascular alterations associated with this condition.   Arterial stiffness has proven to be a predictor of cardiovascular events. Obesity  and target-organ damage such as arterial stiffness are features associated with  hypertension.

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to measure serum  dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) concentration in both genders with  primary aldosteronism (PA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 78 subjects  with normal controls, 46 subjects with essential hypertension and 85 subjects  with PA from October 2007 to June 2011. Subjects with PA were divided into three   subtype groups: aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), bilateral idiopathic  hyperplasia (IHA) and PA with negative imaging findings. RESULTS: Women with PA  (n = 49) had lower serum DHEA-S levels compared with normal controls and subjects  with essential hypertension (p < 0.01). In subtype analysis, only female APAs had  lower serum DHEA-S levels (p < 0.01 compared with normal controls, p < 0.01  compared with subjects with essential hypertension). In APA, a significant  correlation between tumor size and serum DHEA-S was found in women (p < 0.01).  CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that serum DHEA-S levels are lower in women with  PA. In subtype groups, only women with APA had lower serum DHEA-S. There was no  significant difference between subjects with bilateral essential hyperplasia, PA   with negative imaging findings, normal controls and subjects with essential  hypertension in both genders.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that are important  regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in atherosclerosis. Kidney  injury distal to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is aggravated by  atherosclerosis. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that renal miR  expression would be altered in patients with ARAS. METHODS: Patients with  essential hypertension (EH; n = 13) or ARAS (n = 13) underwent a 3-day protocol  study under controlled conditions. For miR levels, blood samples were collected  from EH and ARAS renal vein (RV) and inferior vena cava or peripheral vein of  matched normotensive healthy volunteers (HV; n = 13) and patients with coronary  atherosclerosis (CA; n = 11). Single-renal blood flow was measured in EH and ARAS  using computer tomography to calculate renal gradients and release of miRs.  RESULTS: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was lower in ARAS compared with the  other groups. Systemic levels of most miRs were elevated in CA. RV miR levels  were lower than systemic levels in both ARAS and EH. GFR-adjusted RV levels of  miR-21, 155 and 210 were reduced only in ARAS patients compared with systemic  levels in HV, although cross-kidney gradients were not different from EH. RV  levels of miR-21, 126, 155 and 210 correlated with GFR. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of  atherosclerosis-related miR-21, 126, 155 and 210 are decreased in the  stenotic-kidney vein of ARAS compared with EH patients, likely due to decreased  GFR. Yet, these miRs might be implicated in modulating renal injury in ARAS, and   their RV level may be a marker reflecting their renal expression."|"aras,renal,eh,levels,mirs"|"aras,levels,renal,eh,mir" 
"AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Resistin, a recently discovered proinflammatory cytokine,  has been strongly linked to kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to  determine the relationship of serum resistin with serum cystatin C (sCysC) and  albuminuria, two sensitive endogenous markers of renal function, in elderly male   patients with essential hypertension (EH). STUDY DESIGN: This was a  cross-sectional study enrolling 296 Chinese men (age >/=60 years, mean age 81.42   years) diagnosed with EH between January 2008 and May 2011. Renal function was  assessed by measurement of sCysC levels and albuminuria (calculated as the urine   albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR)). Serum resistin and selected metabolic and  cardiovascular markers were determined by serological testing. Relationships  between serum resistin levels and sCysC levels and uACR were analysed using  multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analyses  revealed that the serum resistin level was positively associated with the sCysC  level and uACR (beta(uACR)=0.132, p(uACR)=0.002; beta(sCysC)=0.015,  p(sCysC)=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that a raised serum  resistin level is a potential indicator of renal dysfunction in elderly patients   with EH. Resistin may be explored as a potential biomarker in addition to sCysC  and uACR to provide a more accurate diagnosis of renal damage in elderly men with  EH."|"resistin,serum,scysc,uacr,renal"|"resistin,scysc,serum,uacr,eh" 
"AB  - This study assessed whether hypertension, a circulating factor, influences local   keloid severity. This retrospective cross-sectional study involved 304  consecutive patients (13-78 years old) with keloids who were surgically treated  in our hospital between January 2011 and August 2013. Their blood pressure (BP),   age and gender, and the size and number of their keloids before surgery were  recorded. Ordinal logistic regression analyses showed that BP associated  significantly with both keloid size and number (all p < 0.0001). Age also  associated with keloid size (p < 0.0001). However, a Goodness-of-fit chi-square  test showed that the prevalence of hypertension was not higher among keloid  patients than in the general Japanese population. This study provides  epidemiological evidence for the possibility that primary hypertension may  aggravate keloids. We propose that the skin, along with the heart and liver, is a  target organ of hypertension. The observations of this study, which require  validation with large-scale prospective interventional trials, suggest that  keloid patients should be screened for hypertension and that antihypertensive  treatments may be of prophylactic and therapeutic value for skin fibrosis."|"hypertension,keloid,study,keloids,patients"|"hypertension,keloid,study,keloids,patients" 
"AB  - We hypothesized that weather and space weather conditions were associated with  the exacerbation of essential hypertension. The study was conducted during  2009-2010 in the city of Kaunas, Lithuania. We analyzed 13,475 cards from  emergency ambulance calls (EACs), in which the conditions for the emergency calls  were made coded I.10-I.15. The Kaunas Weather Station provided daily records of  air temperature (T), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and barometric pressure   (BP). We evaluated the associations between daily weather variables and daily  number of EACs by applying a multivariate Poisson regression. Unfavorable  heliophysical conditions (two days after the active-stormy geomagnetic field or  the days with solar WS>600 km/s) increased the daily number of elevated arterial   blood pressure (EABP) by 12% (RR=1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.21);  and WS>/=3.5 knots during days of T<1.5 degrees C and T>/=12.5 degrees C by 8%  (RR=1.08; CI 1.04-1.12). An increase of T by 10 degrees C and an elevation of BP   two days after by 10 hPa were associated with a decrease in RR by 3%. An  additional effect of T was detected during days of T>/=17.5 degrees C only in  females. Women and patients with grade III arterial hypertension at the time of  the ambulance call were more sensitive to weather conditions. These results may  help in the understanding of the population's sensitivity to different weather  conditions."|"weather,conditions,days,daily,ws"|"weather,conditions,days,12,daily" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is a well-tolerated class of   antihypertensive agents, exhibiting effective antihypertensive and cardiovascular  protective function. The objective of the study was to examine the efficacy and  safety of Allisartan Isoproxil, a newly developed, selective, nonpeptide blocker   of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), in essential hypertensive patients   at low-medium risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A Phase II prospective, randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial comparing Allisartan  Isoproxil 240mg versus placebo was conducted in essential hypertensive patients  at low-medium risk at 8 sites in China. After a 2-week placebo baseline period,  275 patients received once-daily treatment with Allisartan Isoproxil 240mg or  placebo randomly for 8 weeks. Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) was  measured at week 2, 4 and 8. By the end of treatment, mean reductions from  baseline of SBP and DBP in Allisartan Isoproxil and placebo groups were 14.5/10.4  and 8.3/7.7 mmHg, respectively (P<0.01). The rate of effective blood pressure  control in Allisartan Isoproxil group was significantly higher than in placebo  group at week 4 (61.3% vs 50.0%, P<0.05) and week 8 (67.2% vs 48.6%, P<0.01). In   terms of safety and tolerability, there were no report of death and serious  adverse event (SAE) in all subjects. There was no difference of frequency between  two groups in adverse event (AE) and adverse drug reaction (ADR) (P>0.05). No one  withdraw because of an ADR in two groups. 124 patients received additional 56  weeks treatment with Allisartan Isoproxil and 84 of them completed the study. The  rate of effective BP control kept up to 80% since week 24. No significant  clinical change was observed and ADRs were generally mild or moderate during the   long-term study. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Allisartan Isoproxil 240mg was  effective and safe for essential hypertension patients at low-medium risk.

"AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have prioritized a transcription factor,  nuclear receptor 2 family 2 (NR2F2), as being associated with essential  hypertension in humans. Here we provide evidence that validates this association   and indicates that Nr2f2 is a genetic determinant of blood pressure (BP). Using  the zinc-finger nuclease technology, the generation of a targeted Nr2f2-edited  rat model is reported. The resulting gene-edited rats have a 15 bp deletion in  exon 2 leading to a five-amino-acid deletion in the hinge region of the mutant  Nr2f2 protein. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the Nr2f2(mutant)  rats are significantly lower than controls. Because the hinge region of Nr2f2 is   required for interaction with Friend of Gata2 (Fog2), protein-protein interaction  is examined. Interaction of Nr2f2(mutant) protein with Fog2 is greater than that   with the wild-type Nr2f2, indicating that the extent of interaction between these  two transcription factors critically influences BP."|"nr2f2,bp,mutant,interaction,transcription"|"nr2f2,interaction,protein,bp,mutant" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jian Ling Decoction (JLD) is often prescribed to improve  hypertension-related symptoms in China. However, this treatment has not been  systematically reviewed for its efficacy against essential hypertension (EH).  This review aims to assess the current clinical evidence of JLD in the treatment   of EH. DESIGN: Seven electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, the Chinese National Knowledge  Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), the Chinese  Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) and the Wanfang Database, were searched up  to March 2014. Randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing JLD or combined with  antihypertensive drugs versus antihypertensive drugs were included. We assessed  the methodological quality, extracted the valid data and conducted the  meta-analysis according to criteria from the Cochrane group. The primary outcome   was categorical or continuous blood pressure (BP), and the secondary outcome was   quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Ten trials (655 patients) with unclear-to-high  risk of bias were identified. Meta-analysis showed that JLD used alone showed no   BP reduction effect; however, improvement on QOL was found in the JLD group  compared to antihypertensive drugs. A significant reduction in systolic and  diastolic BP was observed for JLD plus antihypertensive drugs when compared with   antihypertensive drugs alone. No serious adverse effects were reported.  CONCLUSIONS: Owing to insufficient clinical data, it is difficult to draw a  definite conclusion regarding the effectiveness and safety of JLD for EH, and  better trials are needed."|"jld,trials,eh,bp,drugs"|"jld,antihypertensive,drugs,trials,bp" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Although low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations have  been shown to predict risk of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease   (CVD), vitamin D repletion has not consistently lowered blood pressure or  decreased CVD. One possibility for this discrepancy is the presence of  considerable metabolic heterogeneity in patients with hypertension. To evaluate  this possibility, we quantified relationships among insulin resistance, 25(OH)D  concentration, and CVD risk factor profile in patients with essential  hypertension. METHODS: Measurements were made of 25(OH)D concentrations, multiple  CVD risk factors, and insulin resistance by the steady-state plasma glucose  concentration during the insulin suppression test in 140 otherwise healthy  patients with essential hypertension. RESULTS: As a group, the patients were  overweight/obese and insulin resistant and had low 25(OH)D concentrations. The  more insulin resistant the patients were, the worse the CVD risk profile was. In   addition, the most insulin-resistant quartile had significantly lower 25(OH)D  concentrations than the most insulin-sensitive quartile (20.3+/-1.4 vs.  25.8+/-1.4ng/ml; P = 0.005). In the entire group, 25(OH)D concentration  significantly correlated with magnitude of insulin resistance (steady-state  plasma glucose concentration; r = -0.20; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There was  considerable metabolic heterogeneity and substantial difference in magnitude of  conventional CVD risk factors in patients with similar degrees of blood pressure   elevation. The most insulin-resistant quartile of subjects had the lowest 25(OH)D  concentration and the most adverse CVD risk profile, and they may be the subset  of patients with essential hypertension most likely to benefit from vitamin D  repletion."|"insulin,cvd,patients,hypertension,oh"|"25,insulin,cvd,oh,patients" 
"AB  - Primary hypertension is increasingly common and is associated with significant  morbidity. Here, we review the history of its discovery and rise during the last   century with an emphasis on studies trying to identify its cause. Early studies  identified a defect in sodium excretion by the kidney as being central to the  pathogenesis. Recent studies have focused on a variety of genetic, congenital  (fetal programming), and acquired mechanisms for causing the defect in  natriuresis. Certain risk factors are apparent, including genetic polymorphisms  that regulate sodium excretion, a congenital reduction in nephron number, obesity  and hyperleptinemia, an elevated sympathetic nervous system, diet (salt and  fructose), and metabolic (hyperuricemia) mechanisms. The kidney shows evidence  for renal arteriolar vasoconstriction, an intrarenal inflammatory response, local  oxidative stress, and intrarenal activation of the renin-angiotensin system.  Recent studies suggest that intrarenal T cells have an important role in causing   hypertension to be persistent, likely due to the induction of a local autoimmune   response to neoantigens such as heat shock protein 70 and protein aggregates  formed by isoketals resulting from lipid peroxidation. Salt retention due to  impairment in pressure-diuresis leads to the release of cardiotonic steroids and   central nervous system effects that cause systemic vasoconstriction and a rise in  blood pressure. Some recent studies suggest that salt may increase blood pressure  not simply by effects on extracellular volume but rather as a consequence of  hyperosmolarity. These new insights could lead to new approaches for the  prevention and treatment of this important disease."|"studies,system,salt,pressure,intrarenal"|"studies,intrarenal,pressure,recent,salt" 
"AB  - Vascular inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of  hypertension and high levels of endocan may reflect ongoing vascular inflammation  in hypertensive patients. In the present hypothesis-generating study, we aimed at  investigating the comparative effects of amlodipine and valsartan on endocan  levels in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. The study population consisted  of 37 untreated hypertensive patients who were randomized to the two treatment  arms. After baseline assessment, each patient was randomly allocated to either 10  mg daily of amlodipine (n = 18, 7 males) or 160 mg daily of valsartan (n = 19, 3   males) and treated for a 3-month period. Sphygmomanometric blood pressure (BP)  and serum endocan were measured before and every 2 weeks during drug treatment.  There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms   as far as baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics are concerned.   After a 3-month treatment period, systolic and diastolic BP values significantly   reduced by antihypertensive treatment (p < 0.001). Furthermore, endocan levels  were significantly decreased in both treatment arms (p < 0.05). However,  amlodipine caused a greater percent decrease in circulating endocan levels  compared with valsartan at the end of the treatment period. Both drugs reduced  high sensitivity C-reactive protein values. However, the statistical significant   difference vs baseline was achieved only in the group treated with amlodipine. No  correlation was found between endocan plasma levels and BP reduction. The results  of this hypothesis-generating study suggest that amlodipine and valsartan  decrease endocan levels in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. The effects,  which are more evident with amlodipine, may contribute to the anti-inflammatory  effects exerted by the two drugs on the vascular target."|"endocan,treatment,amlodipine,levels,valsartan"|"endocan,treatment,amlodipine,levels,hypertensive" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: To classify the renal artery (RA) anatomy based on specific requirements  for endovascular renal artery denervation (RDN) in patients with drug-resistant  hypertension (RH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RA anatomy of 122 consecutive RH  patients was evaluated by computed tomography angiography and classified as two  types: A (main RA >/=20 mm in length and >/=4.0 mm in diameter) or B (main RA <20  mm in length or main RA <4.0 mm in diameter). The A type included three subtypes:  A1 (without accessory RAs), A2 (with accessory RAs <3.0 mm in diameter), and A3  (with accessory RAs >/=3.0 mm in diameter]. A1 and A2 types were eligible for RDN  with the Simplicity Flex catheter. Type B included twi subtypes based on the main  RA length and diameter. Patients were accordingly classified into three  eligibility categories: complete (CE; both RAs were eligible), partial (PE; one  eligible RA), and noneligibility (NE; no eligible RA). RESULTS: Bilateral A1 type  was the most prevalent and was observed in 48.4 % of the patients followed by the  A1/A2 type (18 %). CE, PE, and NE were observed in 69.7, 22.9, and 7.4 % of  patients, respectively. The prevalence of accessory RAs was 41 %. CONCLUSIONS: Of  RH patients, 30.3 % were not eligible for bilateral RDN with the current  Simplicity Flex catheter. This classification provides the basis for standardized  reporting to allow for pooling of results of larger patient cohorts in the  future."|"patients,ra,eligible,type,a1"|"ra,mm,patients,diameter,eligible" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) represents a potential treatment   option for certain patients with resistant arterial hypertension (HT). HT is  associated with chronic vascular inflammation and remodeling, contributing to  progressive vascular damage, and atherosclerosis. The present study aimed to  evaluate the influence of RSD on cardiovascular inflammation and remodeling by  determining serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitive C-reactive  protein (hsCRP), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and tissue inhibitor of  metalloproteinases (TIMP). METHODS: A total of 60 consecutive patients (age 67.9   +/- 9.6 years) undergoing RSD were included. A therapeutic response was defined  as an office systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction of >10 mmHg 6 months after  RSD. Venous serum samples for measurement of hsCRP, IL-6, MMP-2, MMP-9, and  TIMP-1 were collected prior to and 6 months after RSD. RESULTS: A significant  reduction in office SBP of 26.4 mmHg [SBPbaseline 169.3 mmHg (SD 11.3), p <  0.001] was documented 6 months after RSD. The serum levels of hsCRP (p < 0.001)  and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (p < 0.001) were significantly decreased  compared to baseline values. The levels of MMP-9 (p = 0.024) and MMP-2 (p < 0.01)  were significantly increased compared to baseline values. CONCLUSION: In addition  to the effective blood pressure reduction in response to RSD, this study  demonstrates a positive effect of RSD on biomarkers reflecting vascular  inflammation and remodeling. These results suggest a possible prognostic benefit   of RSD in high-risk patients for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular  remodeling as well as end-organ damage."|"rsd,remodeling,patients,mmp,il"|"rsd,mmp,remodeling,001,hscrp" 
"AB  - As the development of hypertension and target organ damage becomes more  prevalent, it becomes exceedingly important to determine the underlying  mechanisms through which this detrimental development occurs. Specifically, our  studies and others have explored mechanisms through which stress elicits a  salt-sensitive response in approximately 20-30 % of the population, resulting in   the early development of hypertension and target organ damage. Data associated  with this stress-induced cardiovascular response pattern have recently  demonstrated additional effects across the body systems including factors  contributing to the development of osteoporosis, obesity, autoimmune disease, and  chronic inflammation. As each of these diseases become more prevalent in  conjunction with hypertension, further research may discover stress and salt  sensitivity to be at the "heart" of the matter for the development of many of  today's most deadly conditions."|"development,stress,hypertension,mechanisms,prevalent"|"development,hypertension,stress,damage,mechanisms" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was implemented in our  primary care setting four years ago. Since then, 450 ABPMs have been performed  and 69 riser subjects identified. The riser pattern is an independent risk factor  for both incidence of cardiovascular events and their associated mortality.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the amount of control of  essential hypertension (EH) among riser patients and to evaluate how our health  professionals manage therapeutic changes in riser individuals. MATERIALS AND  METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study involved 34,289 inhabitants served in a  centre in the Barcelona metropolitan area. EH individuals (450) were recruited  and ABPM was performed following guidelines of the MAPAPRES  (www.cardiorisc.com/MP/index_MP.asp). RESULTS: Good control of blood pressure was  observed in 46% of dipper and non-dipper subjects but only 35% of riser subjects   had blood pressures within good control ranges. The measured cardiovascular risk   was either high or very high in 35% of riser individuals. Changes in medication  were introduced in riser patients with both good and poor blood pressure control.  A second follow-up ABPM was done in only 27% of the riser individuals. In these  subjects, therapeutic changes successfully modified ABPM patterns in 87% of  cases. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic changes in riser patients were introduced when  these subjects were poorly controlled and these changes were highly effective.  Additional ABPM to confirm the effectiveness of therapeutic changes was only  performed in some individuals. Thus, for management of riser patients, more  specific training of health professionals is needed."|"riser,abpm,changes,control,patients"|"riser,changes,abpm,individuals,subjects" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of Qingrehuatan decoction (QRHT) on serum  metabolic profile in young essential hypertension (YEH) patients with abundant  phlegm-heat syndrome and provide a basis for treatment with the decoction.  METHODS: Twelve male YEH patients were randomly selected and serum samples were  collected for examination before and after 4 weeks of the treatment with QRHT.  Twelve healthy males were randomly selected and their serum samples were  collected as a control. All serum samples were detected using metabolomic  technology with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. Differences in metabolites were  studied by principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminate  analysis, which produced scores and loadings plots. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of  treatment, serum substances could be distinguished between the YEH patients with   abundant phlegm-heat syndrome and the control patients. The specific serum endog-  enous metabolites tended to improve after the treatment. QRHT can appropriately  increase the levels of glucose, lactic acid, citric acid, high-density  lipoprotein, phosphatidylcholine, glycerophosphate choline, hydroxybutyrate,  alanine, and glutamate. QRHT could also decrease the levels of low-density  lipoprotein/very low-density lipoprotein, lipids, N-acetyl glycoprotein, and  O-acetyl glycoprotein. CONCLUSION: QRHT can effectively ameliorate metabolic  disorders in YEH Patients with abundant phlegm-heat syndrome. 1H NMR-based  metabolomic technology can provide an objective basis for the treatment of YEH  patients with abundant phlegm-heat syndrome using QRHT."|"qrht,serum,treatment,patients,yeh"|"patients,qrht,serum,treatment,yeh" 
"AB  - The phylogenetic theory of general pathology postulates that in physiology and  pathology the concepts of biological role of arterial tension had been subjected   to inversion. The activation by nephron of synthesis of components  rennin-angiotensin II and increasing of aldosterone secretion are directed not to  increase arterial tension but to preserve volume of piece of third world ocean  privatized by each entity as pool of intercellular medium where all cells  continue to live as billions years before. In phylogenetic sense, early organs  can't regulate effect of physical factor of regulation of metabolism the late one  in phylogenesis of arterial tension. The cause of increasing of arterial tension   is the vasomotor center but not the kidneys. The vasomotor center increases  arterial tension in the proximal section and further hydrodynamic tension in the   distal section of arterial stream and tends to resuscitate function of nephrons,   biological function of endoecology and biological reaction of excretion. The  arterial tension, besides the main role in biological function of locomotion, is   a physical factor of compensation of disorders of biological functions of  homeostasis, trophology, endoecology and adaptation. In phylogenesis, three  levels of metabolism regulation has been developed The specific regulation of  biochemical reactions occurs on autocrine level. In paracrin regulated cell  cenosises, at distal section of arterial stream, metabolism is regulated by  billions of local peristaltic pumps through compensation of biological reaction  of endothelium-depended vasodilatation, micro-circulation, effect of humoral  mediators and hormonal principles. In vivo, from the level of vasomotor center,  metabolism non-specifically and systemic regulates physical factor-arterial  tension through sympathetic activation of heart. The arterial tension in proximal  section of arterial stream overcomes resistance and physically "forces through"  arterioles with disordered micro-circulation. The angiotensin II is a  vasoconstrictor only in distal section of arterial stream. In the process of  pathogenesis of essential metabolic arterial hypertension the paracrin cenosises   of nephron and kidneys are secondary involved into realization of pathological  compensation and very often are "guilty without guilt" as such another "target  organs" as brain, lungs and heart as well."|"arterial,tension,biological,metabolism,compensation"|"arterial,tension,biological,section,metabolism" 
"AB  - Traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) is widely used for essential  hypertension (EH) in China. However, there is no critically appraised evidence,  such as systematic reviews or meta-analyses, regarding the potential benefits and  disadvantages of TCPM to justify their clinical use and recommendation. The aim  of this review was to systematically evaluate and meta-analyze the effects of  TCPM for EH. Seven databases, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, the China  National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database, the  Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Wanfang Database, were searched  from their inception to August 2014 for relevant studies that compared one TCPM  plus antihypertensive drugs versus antihypertensive drugs alone. The  methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane  risk-of-bias tool. The primary outcome measures were mortality or progression to   severe complications and adverse events. The secondary outcome measures were  blood pressure (BP) and quality of life (QOL). Seventy-three trials, which  included 8138 patients, on 17 TCPMs were included. In general, the methodological  quality was low. Two trials evaluated the effects of TCPMs on mortality and the  progression to severe complications after treatment, and no significant  difference was identified compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. No severe  adverse events were reported. Thirteen TCPMs used in complementary therapy  significantly decreased systolic BP by 3.94 to 13.50 mmHg and diastolic BP by  2.28 to 11.25 mmHg. QOL was significantly improved by TCPM plus antihypertensive   drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. This systematic review provided  the first classification of clinical evidence for the effectiveness of TCPM for  EH. The usage of TCPMs for EH was supported by evidence of class level III. As a   result of the methodological drawbacks of the included studies, more rigorously  designed randomized controlled trials that focus on mortality and cardiovascular   events during long-term follow-up are warranted before TCPM can be recommended  for hypertensive patients. Two TCPMs, Song ling xue mai kang capsules and Yang  xue qing nao granules, should be prioritized for further research."|"tcpm,tcpms,trials,eh,evidence"|"tcpm,antihypertensive,drugs,tcpms,eh" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cystathione beta synthase (CBS) gene T833C, G919A,   844ins68 polymorphisms and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels in ethnic Uyghur and   Han patients with essential hypertension (EH) in Xinjiang. METHODS: Four hundred   twenty nine cases including 211 Uyghur and 218 Han EH patients were recruited,  whilst 410 healthy individuals including 210 Uyghurs and 200 Hans were used as  the controls. Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was adopted to  analyze the CBS gene polymorphisms including T833C, G919A and 844ins68.  Enzymoimmunoassay was applied to determine the plasma level of Hcy.  Chemiluminescence was applied to determine the plasma folic acid and vitamin B12.  RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the plasma Hcy level was significantly  higher in the EH group in both ethnic Uyghurs and Hans (P < 0.05). Plasma levels   of Hcy in T833C, G919A genotypes (for both heterozygotes and homozygotes) were  statistically higher than wild types (P < 0.05). A significant difference was  detected in G919A polymorphism between the EH patients and controls in both  Uyghur and [CM(144.5mm] Han ethnics (Uyghur: x(2) = 10.264, P < 0.01; Han: x(2) =  23.075, P < 0.01), and in T833C between the EH patients and controls in ethnic  Uyghurs (x(2) = 40.254, P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that  age (OR=1.151, P=0.047, 95% CI = 1.002-1.323), T833C (CC) (OR = 1.078, P = 0.003,  95% CI = 1.043-1.114), obesity (OR = 1.284, P = 0.021, 95% CI = 1.038-1.590),  hyperhomocysteine (OR = 3.296, P = 0.016, 95% CI = 1.244-8.733) were independent   risk factors for EH among ethnic Uygurs, while age (OR = 1.162, P = 0.007, 95% CI  = 1.042-1.297), obesity (OR = 3.501, P = 0.003, 95% CI = 1.521-8.060),  hyperhomocysteine (OR = 1.046, P = 0.031, 95% CI = 1.011-1.459) were independent   risk factors for EH in ethnic Hans after adjusting for confounding factors.  CONCLUSION: Plasma level of Hcy is associated with ethnic Uyghur and Han patients  with EH in Xinjiang. CBS gene T833C CC genotype may be associated with the EH  among Uyghur ethnics."|"eh,plasma,ethnic,t833c,hcy"|"eh,95,ci,ethnic,plasma" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of genetic markers of antihypertensive drug responses   could assist in individualization of hypertension treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS:  We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify gene loci influencing  the responsiveness of 228 male patients to 4 classes of antihypertensive drugs.  The Genetics of Drug Responsiveness in Essential Hypertension (GENRES) study is a  double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study where each subject received  amlodipine, bisoprolol,hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan, each as a monotherapy,   in a randomized order. Replication analyses were performed in 4 studies with  patients of European ancestry (PEAR Study, N=386; GERA I and II Studies, N=196  and N=198; SOPHIA Study, N=372). We identified 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms   within the ACY3 gene that showed associations with bisoprolol response reaching  genome-wide significance (P<5x10(-8))however, this could not be replicated in the  PEAR Study using atenolol. In addition, 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed  P values of 10(-5) to 10(-7). The 20 top-associated single-nucleotide  polymorphisms were different for each antihypertensive drug. None of these top  single-nucleotide polymorphisms co-localized with the panel of >40 genes  identified in genome-wide association studies of hypertension. Replication  analyses of GENRES results provided suggestive evidence for a missense variant  (rs3814995) in the NPHS1 (nephrin) gene influencing losartan response, and for 2   variants influencing hydrochlorothiazide response, located within or close to the  ALDH1A3 (rs3825926) and CLIC5 (rs321329) genes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide  some evidence for a link between biology of the glomerular protein nephrin and  antihypertensive action of angiotensin receptor antagonists and encourage  additional studies on aldehyde dehydrogenase-mediated reactions in  antihypertensive drug action."|"study,antihypertensive,drug,studies,hypertension"|"study,antihypertensive,drug,nucleotide,polymorphisms" 
"AB  - Identification of susceptibility genes for essential hypertension in humans has  been a challenge due to its multifactorial pathogenesis complicated by gene-gene   and gene-environment interactions, developmental programing and sex specific  differences. These concurrent features make identification of causal hypertension  susceptibility genes with a single approach difficult, thus requiring multiple  lines of evidence involving genetic, biochemical and biological experimentation  to establish causal functional mutations. Here we report experimental evidence  encompassing genetic, biochemical and in vivo modeling that altogether support  ATP1A1 as a hypertension susceptibility gene in males in Sardinia, Italy. ATP1A1   encodes the alpha1Na,K-ATPase isoform, the sole sodium pump in vascular  endothelial and renal tubular epithelial cells. DNA-sequencing detected a  12-nucleotide long thymidine (12T) insertion(ins)/deletion(del) polymorphism  within a poly-T sequence (38T vs 26T) in the ATP1A1 5'-regulatory region  associated with hypertension in a male Sardinian population. The 12T-insertion  allele confers decreased susceptibility to hypertension (P = 0.035; OR = 0.50  [0.28-0.93]) accounting for 12.1 mmHg decrease in systolic BP (P = 0.02) and 6.6   mmHg in diastolic BP (P = 0.046). The ATP1A1 promoter containing the  12T-insertion exhibited decreased transcriptional activity in in vitro  reporter-assay systems, indicating decreased alpha1Na,K-ATPase expression with  the 12T-insertion, compared with the 12T-deletion ATP1A1 promoter. To test the  effects of decreased alpha1Na,K-ATPase expression on blood pressure, we measured   blood pressure by radiotelemetry in three month-old, highly inbred heterozygous  knockout ATP1A1+/- male mice with resultant 58% reduction in ATP1A1 protein  levels. Male ATP1A1+/- mice showed significantly lower blood pressure (P < 0.03)   than age-matched male wild-type littermate controls. Concordantly, lower ATP1A1  expression is expected to lower Na-reabsorption in the kidney thereby decreasing   sodium-associated risk for hypertension and sodium-induced endothelial stiffness   and dysfunction. Altogether, data support ATP1A1 as a hypertension susceptibility  gene in a male Sardinian population, and mandate further investigation of its  involvement in hypertension in the general population."|"atp1a1,hypertension,male,susceptibility,insertion"|"atp1a1,hypertension,12t,gene,male" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenic proteins 4 (BMP4) is associated with cardiac  remodeling under different conditions. However, the role of BMP4 and its gene  polymorphism in the incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in  hypertensive patients remains unknown. METHODS: A total of 1265 patients  diagnosed with essential hypertension (EH) were recruited. Patients were assigned  to LVH+ (n = 420) and LVH- (n = 845) groups. serum BMP4 level was measured and  two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) polymorphisms, 6007C > T and -5826G > A  of BMP4 gene were genotyped. We also inhibited the BMP4 by small interfering RNA   (siRNA). The effect of BMP4 on the hypertrophic response in Human Cardiomyocytes   AC16 cells was studied. RESULTS: We found that the 6007C > T polymorphism of the   BMP4 gene and the serum BMP4 level were significantly associated with the risk to  develop LVH. With TT as reference, multivariate logistic regression analysis  showed the 6007CC genotype carriers had a higher susceptibility to LVH incidence   (adjusted OR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.63-4.31, adjusted P < 0.001). Our in vitro study  shows that the BMP4 inhibition in cardiomyocyte by si-RNA technique significantly  decreased the Ang II induced cardiomyocyte size and protein content per cell,  indicating the importance of BMP4 in the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. CONCLUSION:  Collectively, our data suggest that both the 6007C > T of the BMP4 gene and the  serum BMP4 level may be used as potential marker for LVH incidence among the EH  patients."|"bmp4,lvh,cardiomyocyte,incidence,polymorphism"|"bmp4,lvh,gene,patients,6007c" 
"AB  - Unravelling the complete genetic predisposition to high blood pressure (BP) has  proven to be challenging. This puzzle and the fact that coding regions of the  genome account for less than 2 % of the entire human DNA support the hypothesis  that mechanisms besides coding genes are likely to contribute to BP regulation.  Non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, are emerging as key players of  transcription regulation in both health and disease states. They control basic  functions in virtually all cell types relevant to the cardiovascular system and,   thus, a direct involvement with BP regulation is highly probable. Here we review   the literature about microRNAs associated with regulation of BP and hypertension,  highlighting investigations, methodology and difficulties arising in the field.  These molecules are being studied for exploitation in diagnostics, prognostics  and therapeutics in many diseases. There have been some studies that examined  biological fluid microRNAs as biomarkers for hypertension, but most remain  inconclusive due to the small sample sizes and differences in methodological  standardisation. Fewer studies have analysed tissue microRNA levels in vascular  smooth muscle cells and the kidney. Others focused on the interaction between  single nucleotide polymorphisms and microRNA binding sites. Studies in animals  have shown that angiotensin II, high-salt diet and exercise change microRNA  levels in hypertension. Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with a  miR-22 inhibitor and treatment of hypertensive Schlager BPH/2J mice with a  miR-181a mimic decreased their BP. This supports the use of microRNAs as  therapeutic targets in hypertension, and future studies should test the use of  other microRNAs found in human association studies. In conclusion, there is a  clear need of increased pace of human, animal and functional studies to help us  understand the multifaceted roles of microRNAs as critical regulators of the  development and physiology of BP."|"studies,micrornas,bp,hypertension,regulation"|"bp,micrornas,studies,hypertension,regulation" 
"AB  - There are anatomical and physiological evidences that the ventrolateral (VL)  region of the medulla plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and  that dysfunction at this level may generate hypertension (HT). Vascular  compression by a megadolicho-artery from the vertebrobasilar arterial system at  the root entry/exit zone (REZ) of the glossopharyngeal (IXth) and vagal (Xth)  cranial nerves (CNs) and the adjacent VL aspect of the medulla has been  postulated as a causal factor for HT from neurogenic origin. The first attempts  at microvascular decompression (MVD) of the IX-Xth CNs together with the  neighbouring VL brainstem was revealed promising. These surgical attempts, as  well as the numerous MRI studies, with the goal to detect and identify likely  responsible neurovascular conflicts (NVC), are reviewed. Established criteria for  indication of MVD as an aetiological treatment of apparent essential HT are still  needed."|"ht,vl,mvd,medulla,xth"|"ht,vl,attempts,cns,medulla" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension has a multi-factorial background based on genetic and  environmental interactive factors. ACE, FABP2 and GST genes have been suggested  to be involved in the development of hypertension. However, the results have been  inconsistent. AIM: The present study was carried out to investigate the  association of ACE (rs4646994), FABP2 (rs1799883) and GST (GSTM1 null or positive  genotype and GSTT1 null or positive genotype) genes polymorphism with essential  HTN cases and controls. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study includes 138 essential  hypertension (HTN) patients and 116 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched control  subjects. GST (GSTM1 null or positive genotype and GSTT1 null or positive  genotype) genes polymorphisms were evaluated by multiplex PCR, ACE (rs4646994)  gene polymorphisms by PCR and FABP2 (rs1799883) gene polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP  method. RESULTS: Significant differences were obtained in the frequencies of ACE   DD, II genotype (p = 0.006, 0.003), GSTT1 null, GSTM1 positive genotype (p =  0.048, 0.010) and FABP2 Ala54/Ala54 genotype (p = 0.049) between essential HTN  cases and controls. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that ACE (rs 4646994), FABP2  (rs1799883) and GST (GSTM1 null or positive genotype and GSTT1 null or positive  genotype) genes polymorphism are associated with HTN. Further investigation with   a larger sample size may be required to validate this study."|"ace,fabp2,genotype,genes,htn"|"genotype,null,positive,ace,fabp2" 
"AB  - Nax , an alpha-subunit of the sodium channel encoded by the SCN7A gene, has been   deemed to be a sensor of the concentration of sodium in the brain and may be  involved in salt intake behavior. We inferred that Nax /SCN7A may participate in   the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of essential hypertension  (EH). The present case-control study involving 615 hypertensives and 617  normotensives was performed to investigate the association between SCN7A  polymorphisms and EH in the Northern Han Chinese population. The three common  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3791251, rs6738031, rs7565062) in the  exons of SCN7A were genotyped with the TaqMan assay. Significant association  between SNP rs7565062 and EH was found under the addictive and dominant genetic  models (P = 0.024, OR = 1.283, 95%CI [1.033-1.592]; P = 0.013, OR = 1.203, 95%CI   [1.040-1.392]; respectively). The three SNPs were in close pair-wise linkage  disequilibrium with each other and the haplotype analyses indicated that  haplotype G-A-T was significantly associated with increased risk of EH (P =  0.023, OR = 1.290). In conclusion, our data showed that SNP rs7565062 of SCN7A  was significantly associated with EH and the allele T of rs7565062 or the related  haplotype G-A-T will be a genetic risk factor for EH in the Northern Han Chinese   population."|"scn7a,eh,rs7565062,haplotype,polymorphisms"|"eh,scn7a,rs7565062,haplotype,95" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The genes encoding adipose-derived hormone leptin and its  receptor (LEPR) are increasingly deemed as hypertension-susceptibility genes. In   this meta-analysis, we summarized the association of the II/I polymorphism in  leptin gene and Gln223Arg polymorphism in LEPR gene with hypertension and  circulating leptin. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched. Data  extraction and study quality were assessed in duplicate. Statistical analyses  were carried out with the STATA software (v. 11.2). RESULTS: A total of 11  articles written in English were eligible. Overall analysis identified a  significant association between II/I polymorphism I allele and increased risk of   hypertension under allelic (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P: 1.48;  1.06-2.08; 0.022) and homozygous genotypic (2.27; 1.20-4.29; 0.012) models. The  magnitude of the association for II/I polymorphism I allele with hypertension was  substantiated in Asians and for essential hypertension under both genetic models.  Overall and subgroup analyses failed to reveal any significance for the  association between the Gln223Arg polymorphism and hypertension risk. Carriers of  Gln223Arg polymorphism Gln/Gln genotype had significantly higher circulating  leptin than the Arg/Arg genotype carriers (weighted mean difference; 95%  confidence interval; P: 1.61 ng/mL; 0.02-3.20; 0.047), and this significance  persisted in essential hypertension subgroup (1.69 ng/mL; 0.02-3.35; 0.047).  There were low probabilities of publication bias for the above comparisons.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the contributory role of the II/I polymorphism   in leptin gene in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and this role was more  evident in Asians and for essential hypertension."|"hypertension,polymorphism,leptin,ii,association"|"hypertension,polymorphism,leptin,association,ii" 
"AB  - Hypertensive nephropathy, a consequence of chronic high blood pressure, is  increasingly a cause of end-stage renal diseases and its correct management is  very important for clinical outcome. Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR/Kpo) and  stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP/Kpo) strains represent models of human essential  hypertension. However, the kidney injuries in SHR/Kpo and SHRSP/Kpo are not well   defined. We therefore characterized the renal pathophysiology of SHR/Kpo and  SHRSP/Kpo compared with normotensive control (WKY/Kpo) rats. The SHRSP/Kpo  exhibited increased systolic blood pressure at 10 weeks of age, and proteinuria  and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels at 20 weeks.   We simultaneously detected mononuclear cell infiltration, tubular injuries,  accumulation of extracellular matrix and marked expression of alpha-SMA in the  tubulointerstitium. Additionally, TGF-beta1 and CTGF were up-regulated in the  kidney of SHRSP/Kpo. We lastly focused on changes in glomerular cells of  SHRSP/Kpo. Nestin, a podocyte marker, was detected but decreased slightly in  20-week-old SHRSP/Kpo. PECAM-1 expression was increased in SHRSP/Kpo glomeruli,  indicating the thickening of glomerular endothelial cells. Moreover, we found  that alpha-SMA, a myofibroblast marker, was also upregulated in the glomeruli of   SHRSP/Kpo at 20 weeks. These findings suggest that SHRSP/Kpo could be a valuable   animal model for human hypertensive nephropathy."|"kpo,shrsp,blood,shr,weeks"|"kpo,shrsp,shr,20,blood" 
"AB  - The aim of the study was to find out whether peripheral blood leukocyte  adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1, AdipoR2) protein expression patterns  (flow cytometry) differ between the primary hypertension children (n = 57) and  healthy controls (n = 19) and if their expression levels are related to selected   clinical parameters. The group of 26 patients [AdipoR(-)] showed lower and the  group of 31 patients [AdipoR(+)] showed higher AdipoRs protein expression than  the control and each other (P < 0.01 for neutrophils, P < 0.05 for monocytes).  The AdipoR(+) leukocytes expressed higher AdipoR1 mRNA levels (RT-PCR) than  AdipoR(-) ones and controls (P = 0.022 and P = 0.007, resp.). Despite greater  BMI, the AdipoR(-) patients had unchanged serum adiponectin levels. In contrast,   AdipoR(+) patients had lower serum adiponectin concentrations than the AdipoR(-)   ones and controls (P < 0.001). The AdipoR(+) patients had higher blood pressure  (P = 0.042) and greater carotid intima-media thickness (P = 0.017) than the  AdipoR(-) ones. The stage of hypertension was associated with increased  neutrophil but not monocyte AdipoR1 density (AdipoR1 MFI) (P < 0.05). Severe  ambulatory hypertension was presented more often in AdipoR(+) patients than in  AdipoR(-) ones (51.6% versus 26.9%, resp.; P < 0.01). In conclusion, neutrophil  AdipoRs upregulation was associated with early stages of vascular injury,  hypertension severity, and low serum levels of adiponectin."|"adipor,hypertension,adipor1,patients,levels"|"adipor,patients,adiponectin,adipor1,hypertension" 
"AB  - AIM: The aim of the study is to measure the vasoactive peptides, urotensin II  (UII), endothelin (ET) and adrenomedullin (ADM) in a well-characterized  population of normal controls and patients with essential hypertension, and to  study their association with this disease. METHODS: The contents of plasma UII,  ET and ADM were measured by radioimmunoassay in 40 normal controls and 120  patients with essential hypertension. Echocardiographic examinations were  performed using an ultrasonic system, and the left ventricular end diastolic  diameter (LVEDd) along with the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT)  and interventricular septal thickness (IST) were determined. The left ventricular  mass index (LVMI) was calculated according to the method reported by Devereux et   al. RESULTS: Plasma UII, ET and ADM contents were increased in patients than  healthy controls (3.28 +/- 1.257 pmol/L vs. 1.80 +/- 0.639 pmol/L, p < 0.01), and  correlated with the severity of hypertension in patients. Besides, all the three   vasoactive peptides in plasma had significant correlations with SBP, IST, LVPWT,   LVMI (p </= 0.05), while they showed insignificant associations with LVEDd (p >  0.05). UII was remarkably associated with ADM content, while the association of  UII level with LVEDd and ET content were not significant. CONCLUSION: The  vasoactive peptides UII, ET and ADM may be involved in the pathophysiologic  process of essential hypertension, and function as the indicators for severity of  this disease."|"et,uii,adm,hypertension,ventricular"|"et,uii,adm,hypertension,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the association between total plasma homocysteine (tHcy)  and ischemic stroke (IS) in hypertensive subjects in a matched case-control  study. METHODS: This is a 1:2 matched and population-based case-control study,  all of the participants were recruited from the 60 communities in Shenzhen,  China. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, medical records, lifestyle   risk factors and other clinical characteristics were obtained from all of the  subjects. The association between tHcy and incidence of IS was analyzed by using   conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: The median values of plasma tHcy  were significantly higher in IS subjects than in non-IS subjects, especially in  women. After adjusted for the confounding factors in Model 2, compared with the  lowest quartile of tHcy, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of the highest  quartile of tHcy for IS were 0.83 (0.36-1.90) in men, 4.51 (1.29-15.7) in women  and 1.31 (0.70-2.47) in the total subjects; the ORs and 95% CIs for IS per 5  mumol/L increase in homocysteine were 1.11 (0.99-1.22), 1.25 (1.03-1.58) and 1.15  (1.01-1.28) in men, women and total subjects, respectively. We observed  significant associations in crude model, Model 1 and Model 2 in women for the  comparison of tHcy >/= 15 mumol/L versus < 15 mumol/L. Interaction analysis  showed that the association of tHcy with IS was significant in women  (p-interaction = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This matched case-control study indicates  that tHcy may increase the susceptibility to IS in essential hypertension  subjects, especially in women. Further large prospective cohort studies are  needed to confirm our findings."|"thcy,subjects,women,association,factors"|"thcy,subjects,women,15,model" 
"AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reportedly effective, and  positively indicated in patients with chronic heart failure with decreased  contractility, after myocardial infarction, after cerebrovascular disorders, and   in those with chronic kidney disease. However, the biggest challenge to  continuous use of ACE inhibitors is the adverse reaction of cough. Accordingly,  in the present study, we investigated the present state and characteristics of  ACE inhibitor-induced cough in patients with essential hypertension currently  being treated with an ACE inhibitor for an average of 18 months, who could be  regularly checked for cough. Subjects in this study were 176 patients overall  (mean age 67 +/- 11 years old), 90 men and 86 women. The adverse reaction of  cough was observed in 20% of patients, and more frequently in women than in men.   However, in 26 of the patients with cough, the cough either resolved naturally or  completely disappeared while the treatment continued, after which patients could   continue taking the medication. Specifically, ACE inhibitor treatment was  eventually discontinued due to cough in 5.1% of patients. Cough occurred less  frequently with concomitant calcium antagonists or diuretics than with ACE  inhibitor monotherapy. Cough as an adverse reaction occurred at a low frequency  when medication was taken at bedtime. We considered a number of measures to  counteract cough, then in addition to starting the ACE inhibitor treatment as  early as possible, it is important to devise ways for the ACE inhibitor treatment  to be continued for as long as possible, through the adept use of these measures."|"ace,cough,patients,inhibitor,treatment"|"cough,ace,patients,inhibitor,treatment" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a common disease with a clear genetic component.  Inflammation and endothelial dysfunction play a prominent role in the development  of persistent blood pressure elevation. The aim of the current study was to  detect an association between EH and polymorphic markers in genes encoding for  molecules involved in the control of intercellular interactions during the  inflammation process. We analysed SNPs in SELE, SELP, SELL, ICAM1, VEGFA, IL1B,  IL6, IL10 and IL12B genes in a group of 534 men of Tatar ethnicity (217 patients   with EH and 317 controls). Using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo-based approach  (APSampler), we found genotype and allelic combinations associated with EH. The  most significant associations were observed for SELE rs2076059*C-SELP  rs6131*A-VEGFA -2549*I-IL1B rs16944*C (p = 3.42 x 10(-5), FDR q = 0.035) and SELE  rs2076059*C-SELP rs6131*A-IL12B rs3212227*C-IL1B rs16944*C (p = 323 x 10(-4), FDR  q = 0.035)."|"eh,genes,inflammation,sele,selp"|"eh,il1b,sele,selp,035" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Essential hypertension (EH) is known as the result from the  interaction of environmental and genetic factors. We selected tag SNPs of  CLCNKA_B genes as gene markers, to elucidate the relationship between CLCNKA_B  and EH, and to determine the possible interaction among tag SNPs and dietary  factors in island of China. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in  Changshan islands of China, blood samples of 806 participants were genotyped, and  the general characteristics and dietary habits of them were collected.  Unconditional logistic regression (ULR) was used to assess the effects of  CLCNKA_B tag SNPs and dietary factors on EH. Generalized multifactor  dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to test gene-environment interaction for  EH risk. RESULTS: Four SNPs were identified as the tag SNPs of CLCNKA_B.  Recessive model for rs5253 and rs2275166 were marginal associated with the  decrease risk of EH (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.12-1.07 for rs5253; OR = 0.40, 95% CI   = 0.16-1.05 for rs2275166). In GMDR, the five-factor interaction model of  rs1010069, salt, marine products, meat and edible oil consumption was the best  model, with a maximum CVC of 10/10 and a TBA of 0.638 (p = 0.001). In ULR,  compared with subjects carried wild genotypes and null dietary risk factor, those  with three or more dietary risk factors and mutation genotypes had 5.90-fold EH  risk (95% CI:2.24-15.53). CONCLUSION: Though the single loci of tag SNPs of  CLCNKA_B are not enough to significantly increase the EH susceptibility, the  combination of CLCNKA tag SNP, salt, marine products, meat and edible oil  consumption is associated with elevated risk."|"eh,tag,clcnka,dietary,interaction"|"eh,risk,snps,tag,clcnka_b" 
"AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate whether YKL-40 levels and  epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness were associated with non-dipping  pattern in essential hypertension (HT). Age- and sex-matched 40 dipper  hypertensive patients and 40 non-dipper hypertensive patients were included in  the study. Non-dippers had significantly increased EAT thickness and higher  YKL-40 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels than dippers. Multivariate   logistic regression analysis showed that the EAT thickness and serum levels of  YKL-40 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were independent predictors of  non-dipping pattern in essential HT. In essential HT, presence of non-dipping  pattern is associated with increased inflammatory response."|"non,thickness,eat,levels,ykl"|"40,non,dipping,eat,essential" 
"AB  - TGF-beta receptor-associated protein 1 (TGFBRAP1), as a chaperone, binds Smad4 to  participate in vascular development and remodeling which is closely related to  the aetiology of essential hypertension (EH). Herein, the main aim of this study   is to investigate the genetic susceptibility of TGFBRAP1 to hypertension. A  case-control study comprising 2012 hypertension cases and 2210 controls was used   to generate the hypothesis of the association of TGFBRAP1 gene with EH and  another case-control study in a children population then proceeds to further  replicate the association. Logistic regression model was used to adjust  confounding factor for EH and general linear model (GLM) was applied to compare  blood pressure levels and plasma TGF-beta1 levels between genotypes in cases and   controls. There was no statistical association with EH after the covariates were   controlled for. However, quantitative trait analysis indicated that DBP had a  linear decrease with the variations of rs2679860 (p = 0.005) after adjustment for  confounding factor but the direction of this genetic effect was opposite of that   in the children population. And normally distributed square root of TGF-beta1  (pg/ml) had a linear increased with the variations of rs2679860 (p = 0.042) after  adjusting covariates. Our finding supports the association of rs2679860  polymorphisms of TGFBRAP1 and DBP variation as well as plasma levels of TGF-beta1  and that suggests the variation of rs2679860 might influence the direct  modulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on the blood pressure by regulating the plasma  levels of TGF-beta1."|"tgfbrap1,eh,tgf,association,rs2679860"|"tgf,beta1,association,eh,levels" 
"AB  - Aerobic exercise has been recommended in the management of hypertension. However,  few studies have examined the effect of walking on ambulatory blood pressure  (BP), and no studies have employed home BP monitoring. We investigated the  effects of daily walking on office, home, and 24-h ambulatory BP in hypertensive   patients. Sixty-five treated or untreated patients with essential hypertension  (39 women and 26 men, 60 +/- 9 years) were examined in a randomized cross-over  design. The patients were asked to take a daily walk of 30-60 min to achieve 10  000 steps/d for 4 weeks, and to maintain usual activities for another 4 weeks.  The number of steps taken and home BP were recorded everyday. Measurement of  office and ambulatory BP, and sampling of blood and urine were performed at the  end of each period. The average number of steps were 5349 +/- 2267/d and 10 049  +/- 3403/d in the control and walking period, respectively. Body weight and  urinary sodium excretion did not change. Office, home, and 24-h BP in the walking  period were lower compared to the control period by 2.6 +/- 9.4/1.3 +/- 4.9 mmHg   (p < 0.05), 1.6 +/- 6.8/1.5 +/- 3.7 mmHg (p < 0.01), and 2.4 +/- 7.6/1.8 +/- 5.3   mmHg (p < 0.01), respectively. Average 24-h heart rate and serum triglyceride  also decreased significantly. The changes in 24-h BP with walking significantly  correlated with the average 24-h BP in the control period. In conclusion, daily  walking lowered office, home, and 24-h BP, and improved 24-h heart rate and lipid  metabolism in hypertensive patients. However, the small changes in BP may limit  the value of walking as a non-pharmacologic therapy for hypertension."|"bp,walking,patients,home,hypertension"|"bp,24,walking,home,period" 
"AB  - This study was to assess the relationship between asymmetric dimethylarginine  (ADMA) and carotid atherosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension. A  total of 182 individuals with never-treated essential hypertension and 182  age-matched healthy controls were studied. Plasma ADMA levels, mean intima-media   thickness (IMT) and plaque score were significantly greater in hypertensive  patients than normotensive controls. ADMA was positively correlated with mean  IMT. On multiple logistic regression analysis, ADMA was a crucial independent  predictor of carotid plaque formation (plaque score >/=1.1). Our results suggest   that increased levels of ADMA are associated with the development of carotid  atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients."|"adma,carotid,plaque,patients,imt"|"adma,carotid,patients,plaque,182" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) was one of the main  factors for accelerating atrial fibrosis and has been reported with significantly  higher level in plasma of the patients with essential hypertension (EH),  especially in those with target organ damage. The contribution of TGFbeta1 in the  pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) in EH patients remains unknown. METHODS:  75 EH patients with documented AF were divided into the paroxysmal AF group  (EH+pAF, n = 44) or the chronic AF group (EH+cAF, n = 31), and 37 EH patients  with sinus rhythm (SR) were assigned into the EH+SR group. All data including EH   duration, blood pressure, lipids, glucose and left atrial diameter (LAD) measured  by ultrasonic cardiogram were recorded. The serum levels of TGFbeta1 and  connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were detected, and compared with normal  controls (NC group, n = 36). RESULTS: The serum levels of TGFbeta1 and CTGF in  all EH groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (p < 0.001,  respectively). Among the EH groups, TGFbeta1 and CTGF levels were highest in the   cAF group, followed by the pAF and the SR groups (p < 0.005). However, no  significant difference was observed in TGFbeta1 and CTGF levels between the cAF  group and the pAF group. The serum TGFbeta1 in AF patients was independently  correlated with LAD, the presence of AF, aldosterone, CTGF and age. CONCLUSION:  The serum TGFbeta1 promotes CTGF synthesis and causes left atrial enlargement and  remodeling, which is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of AF in EH patients."|"eh,tgfbeta1,ctgf,patients,atrial"|"eh,group,tgfbeta1,af,ctgf" 
"AB  - To examine the association between pulsatility index (PI) in the common carotid  artery (CCA) as a marker of vascular resistance and cardiovascular risk factors,   including serum homocysteine and inflammation, 67 hypertensive patients were  enrolled. PI correlated with homocysteine and interleukin-6, monocyte count,  gender, age and BMI, with monocyte count and age being independent determinants  for PI. In turn, monocyte count correlated with homocysteine, tumor necrosis  factor-alpha, and HDL-cholesterol, BMI, and gender, with HDL-cholesterol and  homocysteine being independent determinants for monocyte count. These results  indicated monocyte count determined by homocysteine is associated with arterial  stiffness in hypertensive patients."|"homocysteine,pi,count,monocyte,correlated"|"count,homocysteine,monocyte,pi,age" 
"AB  - Japanese patients with uncontrolled essential hypertension received single-blind   losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (L50/H12.5) for 8 weeks. Patients  whose blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled were randomized double-blind to  fixed-dose losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/amlodipine 5 mg  (L50/H12.5/A5) or L50/H12.5 for 8 weeks followed by open-label L50/H12.5/A5 for  44 weeks. Adverse events were assessed. After 8 weeks, diastolic and systolic BP   were reduced significantly more with L50/H12.5/A5 versus L50/H12.5 (both p <  0.001). Mean changes in diastolic and systolic BP were sustained for 44 weeks.  L50/H12.5/A5 was well-tolerated and improved BP significantly versus L50/H12.5 in  Japanese patients with uncontrolled essential hypertension."|"bp,l50,h12,weeks,uncontrolled"|"h12,l50,mg,weeks,a5" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased arterial stiffness independently predicts adverse  prognosis. While different antihypertensive strategies produce different  magnitudes of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) regression, there are no  comparative data on how these strategies affect arterial stiffness. The aim was  to determine the longitudinal change in aortic stiffness following the treatment   of essential hypertension with two mechanistically different antihypertensive  treatment strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two patients with essential  hypertension and CMR confirmed with LVH were randomly assigned to  antihypertensive regimes for 6 months. Treatment strategies were designed either   to inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic  nervous system (SNS) (valsartan and moxonidine, group VM) or to have neutral  effect on these systems (bendroflumethiazide and amlodipine, group BA). Both  treatment groups underwent identical baseline and a 6-month follow-up CMR and  were compared with a healthy age-matched control group. Baseline aortic  distensibility (AD) was lower in both hypertensive groups compared with controls   (2.8 x 10(-3 )mmHg(-1) in group VM (p = 0.001) and 3.3 x 10(-3 )mmHg(-1) group BA  (p = 0.039) compared with 4.5 x 10(-3 )mmHg(-1) in the control group). AD  increased after antihypertensive therapy (VM: 2.8 x 10(-3 )mmHg(-1)-4.2 x 10(-3  )mmHg(-1) (p = 0.001); BA 3.3 x 10(-3 )mmHg(-1)-4.6 x 10(-3 )mmHg(-1) (p <  0.01)). In both treatment groups AD returned to a level comparable with the  normal control group (p = 0.81) after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with  essential hypertension and LVH, AD was lower than in matched normal controls.  Despite the opposing pharmacological mechanisms utilised across the treatment  groups, the improvement in AD was similar, suggesting that blood pressure  reduction per se may be more important than RAAS and SNS inhibition for the  improvement of aortic remodelling."|"treatment,group,ad,strategies,groups"|"10,group,mmhg,treatment,ad" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of NT-proBNP with clinical   and hemodynamic assessment in 156 patients with arterial hypertension. NT-proBNP   correlated positively with, i.e. age (r=0.310, p=0.00008), mean blood pressure  (MBP; r=0.199, p=0.0136), Heather index (HI; r=0.375, p<0.00001) and negatively  with thoracic fluid content (TFC; r=-0.300, p=0.0002). The patients with higher  NT-proBNP were older (46.1 versus 40.6 years, p=0.001), with higher MBP (102.6  versus 98.5 mm Hg, p=0.0043), HI (14.54 versus 11.93 Ohm s2, p=0.009) and lower  TFC (27.5 versus 29.4 1/kOhm, p=0.0032). The independent predictors of higher  NT-proBNP were: age, MBP and HI."|"probnp,nt,versus,hi,mbp"|"nt,probnp,versus,hi,higher" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiotonic steroid marinobufagenin (MBG) is increasingly  suggested to be responsible for some of the cardiovascular injury that has been  previously attributed to aldosterone. We examined the clinical correlates of  circulating MBG concentrations in hypertensive patients and tested the hypothesis  that MBG serves as a reliable diagnostic tool for detecting primary aldosteronism  (PA). METHODS: Plasma MBG concentrations (mean: 0.51+/-0.25 nmol/l) were measured  in the morning fasting samples in 20 patients with PA and 20 essential  hypertensive (EH) controls matched for age, sex, body mass index, renal function,  urinary sodium and intake of antihypertensive medication (mean age: 51.6 years;  52.2% women). RESULTS: Overall, plasma MBG was directly correlated with plasma  aldosterone, aldosterone to active renin ratio (AARR), diastolic blood pressure,   mean carotid intima-media thickness, serum sodium, urinary protein to creatinine   ratio and inversely with serum potassium levels. Plasma MBG levels were  significantly higher in patients with PA compared to EH (mean: 0.68+/-0.12 versus  0.35+/-0.24 nmol/l; p<0.001). ROC analysis yielded a greater AUC for plasma MBG  compared to the AARR, PAC and serum potassium levels for detecting PA. Youden's  Index analyses yielded the optimal plasma MBG cut-off score for diagnosing PA at   >0.49 nmol/l with specificity and sensitivity values of 0.85 and 0.95,  respectively, which were higher than those at the optimum AARR cut-off at >3.32  ng/dl/microU/ml. CONCLUSIONS: In a well-characterized cohort, values of plasma  MBG were significantly related to clinical correlates of cardiovascular and renal  disease. Plasma MBG emerged as a valuable alternative to the AARR for screening  of PA."|"mbg,plasma,pa,aarr,mean"|"mbg,plasma,pa,aarr,mean" 
"AB  - Objective was to investigate the effects of Tai Chi exercise on nitric oxide  (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels, and blood pressure   (BP) in patients with essential hypertension (EH). EH patients were assigned to  the Tai Chi exercise group (HTC, n = 24), and hypertension group (HP, n = 16) by   patients' willingness. Healthy volunteers matched for age and gender were  recruited as control (NP, n = 16). HTC group performed Tai Chi (60 min/d, 6  d/week) for 12 weeks. Measurements (blood glucose, cholesterol, NO, CO, H2S and  BP) were obtained at week 0, 6, and 12. SBP, MAP, and low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol levels decreased, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  increased by week 12 in the HTC group (all p < 0.05 versus baseline). Plasma NO,   CO, and H2S levels in the HTC group were increased after 12 weeks (all p < 0.05  versus baseline). SBP, DBP and MAP levels were significantly lower in the HTC  than in the HP group (all p < 0.05). However, no changes were observed in the HP   and NP groups. Correlations were observed between changes in SBP and changes in  NO, CO and H2S (r = -0.45, -0.51 and -0.46, respectively, all p < 0.05), and  between changes in MAP and changes in NO, CO and H2S (r = -0.36, -0.45 and -0.42,  respectively, all p < 0.05). In conclusion, Tai Chi exercise seems to have  beneficial effects on BP and gaseous signaling molecules in EH patients. However,  further investigation is required to understand the exact mechanisms underlying  these observations, and to confirm these results in a larger cohort."|"group,levels,co,patients,htc"|"group,05,changes,h2s,htc" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Establish a method to identify simultaneously mitochondrial DNA  4401A>G and 4435A>G mutations associated with essential hypertension. METHODS:  The whole genomic DNA of samples carrying mitochondrial DNA 4401A>G and 4435A>G  mutations, double mutation (mtDNA 4401A>G and 4435A>G) as well as wild type were   used as templates. Specifically amplified mtDNA 234 bp fragments between 4344 -  4577 using nested PCR and digested the PCR purified products simultaneously with   two restriction enzymes BfaI and NlaIII. The products were identified by  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Electrophoresis results showed that   electrophoresis bands were specific among different samples. CONCLUSIONS: This  study established a convenient, accurate, and suitable for clinical determination  of mtDNA 4401 A>G and 4435A>G mutations associated with essential hypertension  testing using the new method."|"mtdna,simultaneously,products,samples,dna"|"4435a,4401a,dna,electrophoresis,mtdna" 
"AB  - AIMS: Hypertension, a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a treatable  condition, which offers possibilities for prevention of AD. Elevated angiotensin   II (AngII) is an important cause of essential hypertension. AngII has deleterious  effects on endothelial function and cerebral blood flow (CBF), which may  contribute to AD. AngII blocking agents can thus provide potential candidates to   reduce AD risk factors in hypertensive patients. METHODS: We studied the effect  of 2 months induced hypertension (AngII-infusion via osmotic micropumps) on  systolic blood pressure (SBP) and CBF in 10 months-old wild-type (WT) C57bl/6j  and AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (AbetaPP/PS1) mice, and treatment with two different  antihypertensives, 1) eprosartan mesylate (EM, 0.35mg/kg) or 2)  hydrochlorotiazide (HCT, 7.5mg/kg), after 1 month of induced-hypertension. SBP  was monitored twice each month via tail cuff plethysmography. CBF was measured  with MR by flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery. RESULTS: Chronic  AngII-infusion induced an increase in SBP in both AbetaPP/PS1 and WT mice  accompanied by a decrease in hippocampal and thalamic CBF only in the AbetaPP/PS1  mice. An additional difference between the AbetaPP/PS1 mice and WT mice was that   SBP was much higher in AbetaPP/PS1 mice in both hypertensive and normotensive  conditions. Moreover, both antihypertensives were less effective in reducing  AngII-induced hypertension to normal levels in AbetaPP/PS1 mice, while being  effective in WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that AngII-induced  elevated SBP results in impaired CBF and a decreased response to blood pressure  lowering treatment in a transgenic model of AD. Our findings suggest a relation  between midlife hypertension and decreased CBF in an AD mouse model, similar to  the relation which has been found in AD patients. This translational mouse model   could be used to investigate possible prevention and treatment strategies for AD."|"ad,angii,hypertension,cbf,mice"|"ad,mice,angii,abetapp,cbf" 
"AB  - Young hypertensive adults demonstrate decreased performance on neurocognitive  testing compared with that of normotensive controls. There is emerging,  preliminary evidence that children with hypertension also manifest cognitive  differences when compared to normotensive controls. These preliminary studies  consist mostly of database and single-center studies that focus primarily on  differences in neurocognitive test performance and differences in cerebrovascular  reactivity between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Lessons from the  literature on cognition in adult hypertensives and experience from the  preliminary studies in children informed the design of a current, multicenter,  ongoing study of cognition in children with primary hypertension."|"studies,children,preliminary,differences,normotensive"|"children,differences,normotensive,preliminary,studies" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of perindopril-lercanidipine  combination versus perindopril or lercanidipine monotherapies in patients with  mild essential hypertension. METHODS: A total of 180 patients with mild essential  hypertension were randomly assigned to three groups: group A (perindopril 2 mg  plus lercanidipine 5 mg; n = 60), group B (lercanidipine 10 mg; n = 60) and group  C (perindopril 4 mg; n = 60). The treatment efficacy and the incidence of adverse  events were evaluated at the end of 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment initiation.  RESULTS: The blood pressure in group A was already lower than in group B and  group C at week 4 after treatment initiation. Systolic blood pressure was 148 +/-  13 mmHg in group A, 151 +/- 14 mmHg in group B, and 153 +/- 13 in group C (p <  0.001); diastolic blood pressure was 89 +/- 8, 92 +/- 7 and 92 +/- 6 mmHg,  respectively (p < 0.001). At the end of treatment the normalization rate was  significantly higher in group A, compared with group B and group C (71.7%, 68.3%,  and 48.3%, respectively; p < 0.05). Four adverse events were observed in group A,  while seven and nineteen adverse events occurred in group B and in group C,  respectively. Statistically significant differences in adverse reaction incidence  were reported among three groups. CONCLUSION: Although its results were collected  in an overall limited number of patients in a single center, this study shows  that the combination of perindopril and lercanidipine, compared with  lercanidipine alone or perindopril alone, was effective in improving blood  pressure in mild essential hypertensive patients, and also decreased the  incidence of adverse events."|"group,perindopril,patients,adverse,treatment"|"group,lercanidipine,perindopril,adverse,blood" 
"AB  - The method of estimation of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDVD) of the  brachial artery has been elaborated to the patients with essential arterial  hypertension stage II in combination with diabetes mellitus type 2 using the  method of multivariate regression analysis as an alternative to the reactive  hyperemia test using high-resolution ultrasound. The method allows estimating of   EDVD of the brachial artery on the basis of five traditional parameters of  ultrasound diagnostics without special equipment. This simplifies the diagnosis,   significantly reduces its duration and might have widespread use in the primary  diagnosis."|"method,ultrasound,using,artery,brachial"|"method,artery,brachial,diagnosis,edvd" 
"AB  - The present study aims at comparing the prescribing pattern of antihypertensive  drugs in essential hypertension with specific co-morbid conditions with JNC-VII  and WHO-ISH guidelines. Adult patients of both sex, who were attending medicine  OPD of Shri Krishna Hospital, Karamsad, Gujarat since last 6 months and being  prescribed antihypertensive drug/s for hypertension, were selected for the study.  Hypertensive patients with co-morbities diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart  diseases, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal diseases were included in  the study. Adherence to JNC-VII guideline and WHO-ISH guidelines with respect to   prescribing antihypertensive drugs in patients with diabetes mellitus were found   to be 97% and 40.81% respectively, while it was found to be 72.27% to both the  guidelines in patients with IHD. Similarly in cases of hypertension with CHF,  adherence to prescribing antihypertensive were found to be 93.62% and 38.30%  respectively, whereas for CKD patients, adherence to both guidelines was found to  be same i.e. 33.33%. There is need of following such authentic guidelines in  managing hypertension like chronic disease since these guidelines are based on  various clinical trials and successful attainment of target BP in patients will  be much easier by implementing them."|"patients,guidelines,hypertension,antihypertensive,adherence"|"guidelines,patients,antihypertensive,hypertension,adherence" 
"AB  - CONTEXT: The impairment of the aortic mechanical features constitutes the  independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present research has been the determination of the   influence of the environmental exposure to cigaret smoke on the aortic mechanical  properties, namely, the stiffness and elasticity of aorta, in patients with  essential hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research has covered 128  people with essential hypertension: 64 nonsmokers, declaring the environmental  exposure to cigaret smoke (group A) and 64 nonsmokers declaring the lack of  environmental exposure to cigaret smoke selected on the case to case basis (group  B). Aortic mechanical properties have been evaluated on the basis of the  parameters: aortic stiffness index (AoSI), aortic strain (AoS) and aortic  distensibility (AoD). RESULTS: In group A, the average values of AoSI were  significantly higher, and the average values of AoS and AoD significantly lower  than in group B. It has been documented that the older age and environmental  exposure to cigaret smoke form independent risk factors of increasing the aortic   stiffness expressed by higher values of AoSI, whereas the older age, higher pulse  pressure (PP) values and environmental exposure to cigaret smoke - independent  risk factors of aortic elasticity reduction expressed for the age and "passive  smoking" by lower values of AoS and AoD and for PP - lower values of AoD.  CONCLUSION: In patients with essential hypertension, the environmental exposure  to cigaret smoke seems to result in impairment of the aortic mechanical  properties."|"aortic,exposure,environmental,cigaret,group"|"aortic,cigaret,environmental,exposure,smoke" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: Genetic variation is thought to contribute to the etiology of  hypertension, and E-selectin is a candidate essential hypertension-associated  gene. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we attempted to test the hypothesis that subtle  haplotype variants of SELE genes may be sources of essential hypertension in  Mongolian and Han populations. MATERIALS: A total of 429 unrelated Mongolian  herdsmen and 416 Han farmers were enrolled, including 212 Mongolian essential  hypertension (EH) patients, 217 Mongolian normotensives (controls), 200 Han EH  patients and 216 Han normotensives (controls). METHODS: All nine tag  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the SELE gene were retrieved from  HapMap and the genotyping was performed using a polymerase chain reaction  (PCR)/ligase detection reaction assay. Results The distributions of the A-allele   frequency of rs3917458 and the C-allele frequency of rs2179172 differed  significantly between the hypertensive subjects and controls in the Han  population. The frequency of haplotype GGC was significantly higher in the EH  group than in the controls in the Mongolian population. In the Han population, a   significant difference was observed in the haplotype frequency of TCC between the  patients and controls, whereas haplotype ACA was detected significantly less  often in the EH subjects than in the controls. CONCLUSION: Meanwhile, the  haplotype TCC in the Han hypertensive patients and the haplotype GGC in the  Mongolian patients had independent effects in increasing the risk for EH and  maybe used as risk factors for predicting high blood pressure. However, the  haplotype ACA had an independent effect in decreasing the risk of hypertension  and may be protective in normotensive subjects in the Han population. Therefore,   multiple SNPs in combination in SELE may confer a risk of hypertension."|"han,haplotype,hypertension,mongolian,controls"|"han,haplotype,controls,hypertension,mongolian" 
"AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of gender on the association between   epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and circadian blood pressure (BP) changes in  patients with recently diagnosed essential hypertension (EH). A total of 441  patients with EH (male/female: 236/205, mean age: 50.7 +/- 13.8) and 83 control  patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiography. Obese  EH patients had higher circadian BP profile with BP variability, wall thickness,   and left ventricular mass than nonobese EH patients and controls (all p's <0.05)   without gender differences. EFT was higher in female than in male patients (7.0  +/- 2.5 versus 5.9 +/- 2.2 mm, p < 0.001) and higher in the obese female EH group  (7.5 +/- 2.6 mm) than in the control (6.4 +/- 2.8 mm) or nonobese EH group (6.7  +/- 2.8 mm) among women, whereas EFT did not vary among males (5.9 +/- 1.9 versus  6.0 +/- 2.7 versus 5.9 +/- 2.4 mm, p = 0.937). Multivariate logistic regression  analysis demonstrated that the 24-hour mean BP variability was associated with  SBP (p = 0.018) and EFT (p = 0.016) in female patients, but not in male patients.  The relationships among circadian BP variability, obesity, and EFT were affected   by gender in different manners. EFT may be a more valuable parameter in the  evaluation of BP severity and obesity in women than in men."|"bp,eft,patients,eh,gender"|"patients,bp,eft,eh,mm" 
"AB  - AIM: Primary aldosteronism could exert a negative feedback on prorenin secretion,  of possibly different magnitude, whether it is related to an  aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or an idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA).  The objectives of this study were to evaluate the level of prorenin in three  subgroups: APA, IHA, and essential hypertension; and the performance of the  aldosterone-to-prorenin ratio (APR) for the diagnosis of an APA. METHODS: Seven  hundred and forty-six hypertensive patients with a standardized work-up,  including a prorenin measurement, were considered. Ninety-six patients without  neutral treatment and 38 patients with other forms of secondary hypertension were  excluded. APA and IHA were categorized according to computed tomography scan,  adrenal venous sampling, pathological analysis and improvement of hypertension  after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients had a diagnosis of APA, 57 of IHA  and 504 of essential hypertension. Prorenin was lower in APA and IHA than in  essential hypertension (32.9, 40.4 and 50.3 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). APR   was higher in patients with APA and IHA than in those with essential hypertension  (24.0, 11.8, and 4.0 pmol/l per pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). The APR was more  discriminant than the aldosterone-to-renin ratio to identify APA compared to IHA   (area under the receiver operating curve at 0.750 and 0.639, respectively; P =  0.04). The optimal cut-off values were 22 pmol/l per pg/ml for APR (sensitivity  57.0%, specificity 93.0%) and 440 pmol/l per pg/ml for aldosterone-to-renin ratio  (sensitivity 54.3%, specificity 82.5%). CONCLUSION: Primary aldosteronism and  particularly its most caricatural form, that is APA, seems associated with a  lower level of prorenin than essential hypertension. The APR could be included in  the diagnostic strategy of APA."|"apa,prorenin,iha,patients,apr"|"apa,hypertension,iha,prorenin,apr" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy is a period of considerable change in blood pressure, with  an early pregnancy decrease followed by a late pregnancy rise. High blood  pressure in pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes for the  mother and offspring. We aimed to define normal ranges of blood pressure across  gestation. METHODS: We used repeated antenatal blood pressure measurements  [median (interquartile range) 10 (9-11) per woman] for 10,327 women. Multilevel  models were used to derive longitudinal reference ranges for SBP and DBP from 12   to 40 weeks gestation for the whole cohort, for women with normal pregnancies  (without essential hypertension or preeclampsia who delivered an  appropriate-size-for-gestational age infant at term) and for subgroups of normal   pregnancies defined by different levels of maternal prepregnancy BMI, smoking and  parity. RESULTS: In normal pregnancies, the mean (95% reference range) SBP and  DBP for nulliparous women at 12 weeks gestation were 112.1 (88.6-135.5) and 65.4   (48.9-81.9) mmHg, and at 37 weeks were 116.0 (92.3-139.7) and 70.0 (52.2-87.9)  mmHg, respectively. For every additional 10 mm Hg of blood pressure at 12 weeks,   normal ranges were 2-3 mm Hg higher across gestation. Reference ranges for  multiparous women were 1-2 mm Hg lower throughout pregnancy. Stratified reference  ranges were higher for women in higher prepregnancy BMI categories, and lower for  smokers than for nonsmokers throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Normal ranges for  blood pressure vary with gestation age and by maternal subgroups. Whole  population and stratified normograms could be used as a reference to identify  abnormal trajectories."|"normal,pressure,blood,pregnancy,women"|"blood,normal,pregnancy,pressure,ranges" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important facet of blood  pressure regulation physiology. Treatment of essential hypertension targets the  RAS using Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs). However, ACEIs are  not uniformly effective and show inter-individual pharmacodynamic variations.  AIM: To assess the correlation between genetic polymorphisms in the genes coding   for RAS components (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE I/D), alpha-adducin (ADD1)  and beta1 -adrenoreceptor (beta1-ADR)) and response to Ramipril. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: We recruited 120 patients with essential hypertension who were  administered Ramipril monotherapy initially, followed by combination therapy, if   needed, based on their responses. Relationship between genotypes of the three  candidate genes and decrease in the blood pressure (BP) was analyzed. RESULTS:  One hundred and six patients were evaluable at the end of the study period and 21  different genotypes were observed among them. Seven of them were classified as  responders after 8 weeks and at the end of 12 weeks, an additional 77 (72.64%)  were deemed responders. 19/22 non-responders were treated with combination  therapy and 7/19 (36.84%) showed a response to the same. There was a significant   difference between the proportions of responders and non-responders among the  genotypes of the ADD1 and beta1-ADR genes (P=0.005 and 0.003, respectively). The   best predictors of response to Ramipril 5 mg daily were the II/GG/SS, II/TG/SS,  II/GG/SG, ID/GG/SS, ID/GG/SG and ID/TT/SS and DD/GG/SS; II/GG/GG, II/TT/SG,  ID/TG/SG, ID/TT/SG, DD/GG/SG and DD/GG/GG were moderately predictive and  II/TT/SS, II/TG/GG, ID/TG/GG, DD/TG/SG and DD/TG/GG were poorly predictive of  response. DISCUSSION: Variable responses to Ramipril may be the result of genetic  factors. CONCLUSION: Pre-prescription genotyping may help individualize  treatment."|"ramipril,response,genes,ras,responders"|"gg,ii,sg,id,ss" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: to assess efficacy of a fixed combination of perindopril arginine and  amlodipine besylate in the treatment of hypertensive patients with chronic heart   failure (CHF) and signs of chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Persons with CKD (n = 53, age 64.5 +/- 8.2 years) were selected from 118 patients  with grade 2-3 essential hypertension with CHF. Presence of CKD was confirmed by   elevated blood levels of cystatin C and lowered glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Used doses of fixed perindopril/amlodipine combination were 5/5, 5/10, 10/10 mg.   Efficacy was assessed after 2 months of therapy on the basis of results of the  examination which included clinical blood pressure (BP), BP monitoring, 6-min  walk test. Blood levels of creatinine, urea, cystatin C and GFR were also  measured. RESULTS: Target BP was achieved in 92.6% of patients. Clinical BP was  significantly decreased. Daily average systolic BP decreased by 14.7%, diastolic   BP--by 14.4%. Systolic and diastolic BP load also decreased. Clinical condition  improved. Tolerance to physical work increased. Level of cystatin C significantly  decreased while GFR increased.

"AB  - AIM: to study laboratory parameters of endothelial dysfunction (ED) and their  correlation with risk factors (RF) of cardiovascular diseases at early stages of   essential arterial hypertension (AH) in adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We  examined 299 adolescents aged 12-18 years with EAH. According to results of  24-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring all patients were divided into three  groups: (1) 98 adolescents with "white coat hypertension", (2) 108 adolescents  with liable AH (LAH), (3) 93 patients with stable AH (stAH). Control group  consisted of 27 healthy adolescents. Examination included 24-hour BP monitoring,   measurement of some laboratory parameters of ED (Von Willebrand factor [vWF],  nitric oxide metabolites, urine catecholamines), and assessment of cardiovascular  RF. RESULTS: Mean vWF values in groups (2) and (3) were clinically significantly   different from control. Increase of vWF activity by 1 unit was associated with  increase of mean nocturnal pulse pressure by 0.36 mm Hg (p = 0.048). Markers of  ED were related to family history of AH, overweight and low birth weight."|"ah,adolescents,ed,vwf,groups"|"adolescents,ah,ed,vwf,24" 
"AB  - Erythropoietin (ERO) is known to be the main regulator of proliferation and  terminal dissociation of erythroid cells. Its receptors are expressed not only in  hematopoietic cells but also in the tissues of the cardiovascular system. The aim  of this work was to study specific features of circadian rhythm in erythropoietin  synthesis and estimate the predictive informative value of serum ERO level  variations as regards the risk of developing cardiovascular complications in  patients with stage II essential arterial hypertension (EAH). ERO, neopterin, and  interleukin-1 levels were measured in 200 such patients. It was shown that ERO  levels increased (p < 0.001) compared with normal values (12.6 pg/ml, 95% CI  11.8-13.4 and 68 pg/ml, 95% CI 6.4-7.2 respectively). Analysis of circadian  rhythm demonstrated that enhanced probability of complications in the absence of   reduction of the ERO level at night time correlated with the decreased number of   CD34 cells (p < 0.001) and the increased neopterin level (p < 0.001). It is  concluded that these dependences suggest the necessity of further studies of yet   unknown effects of ERO and ways of their application for the treatment of EAH."|"ero,level,cells,complications,cardiovascular"|"ero,001,cells,level,95"

"AB  - The oxidative stress state is characterized by an increase in oxygen reactive  species that overwhelms the antioxidant defense; we do not know if these  pathological changes are correlated with alterations in left ventricular  mechanics. The aim was correlating the oxidative stress state with the left  ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the left ventricular end  diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Twenty-five patients with essential hypertension and   25 controls paired by age and gender were studied. All of the participants were  subjected to echocardiography and biochemical determination of oxidative stress  markers. The hypertensive patients, compared with control subjects, had  significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of oxidized proteins (5.03 +/- 1.05 versus  4.06 +/- 0.63 nmol/mg), lower levels of extracellular superoxide dismutase  (EC-SOD) activity (0.045 +/- 0.02 versus 0.082 +/- 0.02 U/mg), higher LVEDP (16.2  +/- 4.5 versus 11.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg), and lower GLS (-12% versus -16%). Both groups  had preserved ejection fraction and the results showed a positive correlation of   oxidized proteins with GLS (r = 0.386, p = 0.006) and LVEDP (r = 0.389, p =  0.005); we also found a negative correlation of EC-SOD activity with GLS (r =  -0.404, p = 0.004) and LVEDP (r = -0.347, p = 0.014)."|"gls,left,ventricular,stress,versus"|"gls,lvedp,versus,left,oxidative" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polymorphisms in genes coding G-protein subunits (alpha, beta, and   gamma) may affect the response of stimulated alpha2A-adrenergic receptors, which   are involved in the regulation of blood pressure. OBJECTIVES The aim of the  present study was to determine the association between the rs11559300 (A/G),  rs199705300 (C/A), rs61754630 (C/T), rs13093 (C/A), and rs41284589 (C/T) single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene coding G-protein gamma5 subunit  (GNG5) and the risk of essential hypertension in the population of Poland.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total number of 838 subjects were included in the study:   536 patients with diagnosed essential hypertension and 302 controls. Genotyping  was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism  (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: Of the studied GNG5 polymorphisms, only SNP rs13093  was significantly associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension  (odds ratio [OR], 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-5.05; P = 0.0036). In   addition, the T allele of rs41284589 may protect against hypertriglyceridemia  (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: rs13093 in the promoter region of GNG5   may be associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension in the Polish   population. Further studies are needed to explain the molecular mechanism by  which rs13093 affects blood pressure."|"rs13093,may,gng5,essential,polymorphisms"|"essential,hypertension,rs13093,gng5,polymorphisms" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to compare therapeutic effects of chosen  antihypertensive drugs on arterial stiffness, shear stress in carotid arteries  and metalloproteinases activity, moreover analysis of relationship of these  variables in the course of treatment. METHODS: 95 patients with essential  arterial hypertension stage 1 or 2 were randomized to 6 months monotherapy with:   quinapril, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan or bisoprolol. Each  therapeutic group consisted of 19 patients (N=19). Before and then after 1, 3 and  6 months of treatment carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) by using a  Complior device, ultrasound of carotid arteries were performed. Blood samples for  the measurement of whole blood viscosity were taken during each visit. Shear  stress (SS) was calculated using measured variables: blood viscosity and velocity  of blood flow. Serum concentration of metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) and plasma  concentration of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase I (TIMP-1) were measured  at the initial visit and after 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: ANOVA for repeated  measurements revealed for all groups significant decrease of PWV (DeltaPWV) and  MMP-3 (DeltaMMP-3) concentration and increase of shear stress in carotid artery  and TIMP-1 (DeltaTIMP-1) concentration (p<0.05). No between groups differences  appeared in above effects (p>0.05). The multiple regression analysis for the  change of PWV (DeltaPWV) in the study group considering all investigated  variables at R2 = 0,27 revealed its significant relation to PWV at first visit,  DeltaTIMP-1, DeltaMMP-3 and Delta shear stress counted for the maximum flow  velocity in common carotid artery. Conclusion: Irrespectively of chosen drug we  observed similar effect for PWV drop. Reduction of arterial stiffness as a result  of antihypertensive therapy is strongly connected with shear stress increase that  is secondary to blood flow velocity growth and changes in connective tissue  metabolism."|"pwv,carotid,shear,stress,velocity"|"blood,carotid,pwv,shear,stress" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate associations between the  renin gene (REN) and the risk of essential hypertension and blood pressure (BP)  levels in Koreans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To outline the functional role of a  single nucleotide polymorphism in the transcription of the REN gene, we conducted  a case-control study of 1975 individuals: 646 hypertension (HT) patients and 1329  ethnically and age-matched normotensive subjects. RESULTS: Logistic regression  analysis indicated that the genotypes AA/AG were strongly associated with risk of  HT (odds ratio, 1.493; 95% confidence interval, 1.069-2.086, p=0.018) in female  subjects. The genotypes AA/AG also showed significant association with higher  blood pressure levels, both systolic and diastolic, in postmenopausal HT women  (p=0.003 and p=0.017, respectively). Analysis of the promoter containing  rs6682082 revealed a 2.4+/-0.01-fold higher activity in the A variant promoter  than the G variant promoter, suggesting that rs6682082 is itself a functional  variant. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the A allele of rs6682082 is a positive  genetic marker for predisposition to essential hypertension and high BP in Korean  women and may be mediated through the transcriptional activation of REN."|"ren,hypertension,ht,rs6682082,risk"|"ht,hypertension,promoter,ren,rs6682082" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: Insulin resistance plays a role in the development of dementia and  hypertension. We investigated a possible relationship between cognitive  impairment and insulin resistance in elderly Chinese patients with primary  hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two hypertensive  elderly patients (>60 years) were enrolled in this study, and assigned into  either the cognitive impairment group (n=61) or the normal cognitive group  (n=71). Gender, age, education, body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR),  total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), C-reactive protein (CRP), high density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),  creatinine (Cr), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS),  homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), systolic   blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking history, atherosclerosis and  the proportion of uncontrolled hypertension were compared between the two groups.  Multi-factorial logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: No  significant differences were found in gender, age, TC, CRP, HDL-C, LDL-C, Cr, BP,  smoking history, atherosclerosis and the proportion of uncontrolled hypertension   between the two groups. The cognitive impairment group had lower education  levels, and higher BMI, WHR, TG, FPG, FINS, and HOMA-IR levels than the control  group. Logistic regression analysis revealed the levels of education, BMI, WHR,  and HOMA-IR as independent factors that predict cognitive impairment in patients.  CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that poor education and increased BMI, WHR,  and HOMA-IR are independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in elderly  patients with hypertension. Insulin resistance plays an important role in the  development of cognitive impairment in primary elderly hypertensive patients."|"cognitive,impairment,hypertension,insulin,education"|"cognitive,impairment,hypertension,insulin,patients" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in sympathetic drive to the heart and the peripheral  circulation characterizes mild and severe essential hypertension. However, it  remains unsettled whether sympathetic cardiovascular influences are potentiated  in true resistant hypertension (RHT). METHODS: In 32 RHT patients treated with  4.6 +/- 0.3 drugs (mean +/- SEM) and aged 58.6 +/- 2.1 years, 35 non-resistant  treated hypertensives (HT) and 19 normotensive controls (NT), all age-matched  with RHT, we measured clinic, 24-hour ambulatory and beat-to-beat blood pressures  (BP), heart rate (HR, EKG), muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA,  microneurography) and spontaneous baroreflex MSNA-sensitivity. RESULTS: BP values  were markedly greater in RHT patients than in NT and HT (172.2 +/- 1.7/100.7 +/-   1.2 vs 132.1 +/- 1.3/82.1 +/- 0.9 and 135.5 +/- 1.2/83.6 +/- 0.9 mmHg, P < 0.01).  This was paralleled by a significant and marked increase in MSNA (87.8 +/- 2.0 vs  46.8 +/- 2.6 and 59.3 +/- 1.7 and bursts/100 heartbeats, P < 0.01). In multiple  regression analysis the MSNA increase observed in RHT was significantly related  to hemodynamic, hormonal and metabolic variables. It was also significantly  related to plasma aldosterone values as well as spontaneous baroreflex  MSNA-sensitivity, which were the variables that at the multivariate analysis were  more closely related to the adrenergic activation of RHT after adjustment for  confounders, including antihypertensive treatment (r(2)partial=0.04405 and  r(2)partial=0.00878, P<0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the  first evidence that RHT is a state of marked adrenergic overdrive, greater for  magnitude than that detectable in HT. They also suggest that impaired baroreflex   mechanisms, along with hemodynamic and neurohumoral factors, may be responsible  for the phenomenon."|"rht,msna,sympathetic,related,increase"|"rht,msna,baroreflex,ht,increase" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: MicroRNAs are potent regulators of gene expression and may serve as  disease markers. This study aimed to identify the plasma microRNA signature in  hypertensive patients, which may help better understand the mechanisms underlying  the pathogenesis of hypertension and target organ impairment. METHODS AND  RESULTS: Plasma samples from three independent cohorts were analyzed to identify   circulating microRNA candidates associated with hypertension in patients. The  results revealed that the plasma level of hsa-miR-505, a previously reported  tumor suppressive microRNA, was significantly elevated in hypertensive patients.   Further studies were carried out in endothelial cells to elucidate the functional  significance of the enhanced level of hsa-miR-505. The results showed that  hsa-miR-505 expression markedly impaired the migration and tube formation of all   three types of endothelial cells examined. Moreover, gene expression analyses and  luciferase reporter assay revealed that FGF18, a proangiogenic factor, is a  target directly regulated by hsa-miR-505 in endothelial cells, which may in part   underlie the function of hsa-miR-505 in angiogenic processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings indicate that hsa-miR-505 is a novel circulating signature of  hypertension, which may play a role in angiogenesis. Our results provide  mechanistic insights into hypertension-associated pathogenesis and point  hsa-miR-505 as a potential target for intervention of hypertension."|"mir,hsa,may,hypertension,expression"|"505,hsa,mir,hypertension,results" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of myocardial performance index (MPI) in  assessing LV function in patients with primary hypertension (HP). METHODS: We  studied 130 patients with HP (mean age 54.9+/-13.3 years)and 155 healthy control   subjects (mean age 52.4+/-11.6 years). MPI was determined by tissue doppler  imaging using the following formula: MPI=(isovolumic contraction time +  isovolumic relaxation time)/ ejection time. The HP group was divided into  hypertrophy subgroup( LVMI>/=115 g/m(2) in males, or >/=95 g/m(2) in females) and  normal mass subgroup(LVMI <115 g/m(2) in males, or<95 g/m(2) in females).  RESULTS: MPI was significantly different in control group, normal mass subgroup  and hypertrophy subgroup(0.72+/-0.23 vs. 0.54+/- 0.17 vs. 0.45+/-0.11, P<0.001).   Hypertrophy subgroup had significant higher MPI than normal mass subgroup(P  =0.046), and both the groups had significant higher MPI than control group(all  P<0.001). MPI was positively associated with age(r=0.369,P<0.001), Left  ventricular end diastolic diameter(r=0.169, P<0.05), Sm(r=-0.211, P<0.001) and  Em(r=-0.383, P<0.001) in control group. In multiple linear regression analysis,  MPI was independently related to age (beta=0.492, t=7.222,P<0.001) in control  group. Among the HP patients, MPI was positively associated with left atrial area  (r=0.293, P<0.001),intra ventricular septum(IVS) diameter (r=0.453, P<0.001),  LVMI (r=0.453, P<0.001), relative wall thickness(r=0.458, P<0.001), and  negatively associated with Sm(r=-0.414, P<0.001), Em(r=-0.508, P<0.001), left  ventricular ejection fraction (r=-0.305, P<0.001) in bivariate analysis. In the  multiple linear regression analysis, MPI was independently related to Em  (beta=0.401, t=4.256,P<0.001) and IVS diameter (beta=-0.365, t=-3.878,P<0.001) in  the HP patients. CONCLUSION: The HP patients had elevated MPI, especially in the   ones with LV hypertrophy. Tissue doppler imaging (TDI) derived MPI could be a  useful index to evaluate the overall cardiac function in HP patients."|"mpi,hp,patients,control,group"|"001,mpi,hp,patients,subgroup" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate current situation of blood pressure control in patients  with hypertension in 22 community health centers of Shenzhen Futian District, and  to find out related factors which affect blood pressure control. METHODS: In the   study, 10 020 cases with essential hypertension that had been registered in 22  Community Health Centers were selected as cases for the survey. The  questionnaires, physical examinations, and laboratory tests were used to obtain  the patients' baseline data. RESULTS: The mean blood pressure (median) levels  were 142/86 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). Those of the males were higher than those of  the females (142/86 mmHg vs. 140/85 mmHg, ZSBP=-6.14,ZDBP=-9.93,P<0.001), the  systolic blood pressure increased with age. The overall blood pressure control  rate was 40.2%. The blood control rates were different with different gender,  body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. The majority of the patients took   single antihypertensive drug, and the proportion accounted to 54.4%. Regression  analysis showed that gender, age, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and waist  circumference were the main factors that affected blood pressure control.  CONCLUSION: The blood control rate was low in these communities. Patients with  high blood pressure often merge a variety of factors that affect blood pressure  control, and at the same time of antihypertensive therapy for the patients, we  should pay attention to the control of these factors."|"blood,pressure,patients,control,factors"|"blood,control,pressure,patients,factors" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously characterized several antihypertensive peptides in  simulated digests of cooked eggs and showed blood pressure lowering property of  fried whole egg digest. However, the long-term effects of this hydrolysate and  its fractions on blood pressure are not known. Therefore, the objectives of the  study were to determine the effects of long term administration of fried whole  egg hydrolysate and its fractions (i.e. egg white and egg yolk) on regulation of   blood pressure and associated factors in cardiovascular disease such as plasma  lipid profile and tissue oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of essential hypertension.  Hydrolysates of fried egg and its fractions were prepared by simulated  gastro-intestinal digestion with pepsin and pancreatin. 16-17 week old male SHRs   were orally administered fried whole egg hydrolysate, non-hydrolyzed fried whole   egg, egg white hydrolysate or egg yolk hydrolysates (either defatted, or not)  daily for 18 days. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were monitored by  telemetry. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the treatment for vascular  function studies and evaluating plasma lipid profile and tissue oxidative stress.  BP was reduced by feeding fried whole egg hydrolysate but not by the  non-hydrolyzed product suggesting a critical role for in vitro digestion in  releasing anti-hypertensive peptides. Egg white hydrolysate and defatted egg yolk  hydrolysate (but not egg yolk hydrolysate) also had similar effects. Reduction in  BP was accompanied by the restoration of nitric oxide (NO) dependent  vasorelaxation and reduction of plasma angiotensin II. Fried whole egg  hydrolysate also reduced plasma levels of triglyceride although it was increased   by the non-hydrolyzed sample. Additionally the hydrolyzed preparations attenuated  tissue oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that fried egg  hydrolysates exert anti-hypertensive effects, improve plasma lipid profile and  attenuate tissue oxidative stress in vivo."|"egg,fried,plasma,hydrolysate,effects"|"egg,hydrolysate,fried,plasma,blood" 
"AB  - We assessed whether red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with serum  uric acid (UA) level in a group of 512 patients with newly diagnosed  hypertension, recruited in Beijing. Patients were divided into high uric acid  group and low uric acid group according to the median (334.9 mumol/L) of serum  uric acid. Compared with the low uric acid group, the patients with high uric  acid had higher red blood cell count (P < 0.001) and RDW (P = 0.032). The  multiple linear regression analysis showed that RDW (P = 0.001) was positively  correlated with uric acid level after the adjustment of related factors. Stepwise  multiple logistic regression model confirmed that RDW (odds ratio: OR = 1.75) was  independent determinants of high serum uric acid as well as sex (OR = 6.03),  triglycerides (OR = 1.84), and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN, OR = 1.30). RDW may be  independently associated with serum UA level in patients with newly diagnosed  hypertension. To firmly establish the causal role of RDW in the incidence of high  uric acid level among hypertensive patients, large cohort studies are needed.  of Traditional Chinese Medicine Gan Organ of SATCM, Xiangya Hospital, Central"|"rdw,acid,uric,patients,serum"|"acid,uric,rdw,patients,group" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the association between cytomegalovirus (CMV)  infection and hypertension in Kazakh and Han populations from Xinjiang Province,   China. MATERIAL/METHODS: We analyzed data on 800 Kazakhs (467 hypertension  patients and 333 healthy control participants) and 800 Hans (482 hypertension  patients and 318 healthy control participants) aged 18-84 years old. ELISA and  real-time quantitative PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism   analysis were applied for determining CMV infection and glycoprotein B (gB)  genotypes, respectively. RESULTS: Serologic evidence of CMV infection was  obtained for 95.4% and 90.1% of the Kazakhs and Hans, respectively. The CMV  seroprevalence rates among the Kazakh and Han participants with hypertension were  96.8% and 89.8%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed  statistically significant independent associations between CMV seropositivity and  hypertension in Kazakh males and between CMV antibody titers and hypertension in   Hans; significant relationships also existed between CMV antibody titers and  blood pressure in Hans. In Kazakhs, 3 CMV gB genotypes were identified: gB2 and  genotype mixtures gB1+gB2 and gB2+gB3. In Hans, 4 CMV gB genotypes were  identified: gB1, gB2, gB1+gB2, and gB2+gB3. Of the 4 studied genotypes, gB2+gB3  showed a significant independent association with hypertension in Kazakh females.  CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection is associated with essential hypertension in Kazakh  males and Hans in Xinjiang. CMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in  Kazakh males, and CMV antibody titers are associated with blood pressure and  hypertension in Han males and females. Moreover, the CMV gB2+gB3 genotype mixture  is associated independently with essential hypertension in Kazakh females."|"cmv,hypertension,kazakh,infection,hans"|"cmv,hypertension,gb2,kazakh,hans" 
"AB  - It was previously demonstrated that metabolic syndrome in humans is associated  with an impairment of insulin signalling in circulating mononuclear cells. At  least in animal models of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may correct alterations of  insulin signalling in the skeletal muscle. In the first study, we investigated  the effects of a 3-month treatment with an ARB with additional PPARgamma agonist   activity, telmisartan, or with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker,  nifedipine, on insulin signalling in patients with mild-moderate essential  hypertension. Insulin signalling was evaluated in mononuclear cells by isolating   them through Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation and protein analysis by  Western Blot. An increased expression of mTOR and of phosphorylated (active) mTOR  (p-mTOR) was observed in patients treated with telmisartan, but not in those  treated with nifedipine, while both treatments increased the cellular expression   of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4). We also investigated the effects of  antihypertensive treatment with two drug combinations on insulin signalling and  oxidative stress. Twenty essential hypertensive patients were included in the  study and treated for 4 weeks with lercanidipine. Then they were treated for 6  months with lercanidipine + enalapril or lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide. An   increased expression of insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and an increased activation of  p70S6K1 were observed during treatment with lercanidipine + enalapril but not  with lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide. In conclusion, telmisartan and  nifedipine are both effective in improving insulin signalling in human  hypertension; however, telmisartan seems to have broader effects. The combination  treatment lercanidipine + enalapril seems to be more effective than lercanidipine  + hydrochlorothiazide in activating insulin signalling in human lympho-monocytes."|"insulin,signalling,telmisartan,treatment,increased"|"insulin,lercanidipine,signalling,increased,telmisartan" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: K(+) channels are central to vascular pathophysiology. Previous  results demonstrated that phenotypic modulation associates with a change in Kv1.3  to Kv1.5 expression, and that Kv1.3 blockade inhibits proliferation of VSMCs  cultures. PURPOSE: To explore whether the Kv1.3 to Kv1.5 switch could be a marker  of the increased risk of intimal hyperplasia in essential hypertension and  whether systemic treatment with Kv1.3 blockers can prevent intimal hyperplasia  after endoluminal lesion . METHODS: Morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis  were performed in arterial segments following arterial injury and constant  infusion of the Kv1.3 blocker PAP-1 during 28 days. Differential expression of  K(+) channel genes was studied in VSMC from hypertensive (BPH) and normotensive  (BPN) mice, both in control and after endoluminal lesion. Finally, the migration   and proliferation rate of BPN and BPH VSMCs was explored in vitro. RESULTS:  Changes in mRNA expression led to an increased Kv1.3/Kv1.5 ratio in BPH VSMC.  Consistent with this, arterial injury in BPH mice induced a higher degree of  luminal stenosis, (84 +/- 4% vs. 70 +/- 5% in BPN, p < 0.01), although no  differences in migration and proliferation rate were observed in cultured VSMCs.   The in vivo proliferative lesions were significantly decreased upon PAP-1  systemic infusion (18 +/- 6% vs. 58 +/- 20% with vehicle, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:  Hypertension leads to a higher degree of luminal stenosis in our arterial injury   model, that correlates with a decreased expression of Kv1.5 channels. Kv1.3  blockers decreased in vitro VSMCs proliferation, migration, and in vivo intimal  hyperplasia formation, pointing to Kv1.3 channels as promising therapeutical  targets against restenosis."|"kv1,arterial,bph,proliferation,vsmcs"|"kv1,arterial,bph,expression,proliferation"

"AB  - Essential hypertension is a very common health condition that is associated with   an array of long-term end-organ diseases, including premature cardiovascular  disease. Currently, there is no effective method to identify high-risk patients  who may develop cardiovascular comorbidities in the future. Clinically, it would   be beneficial to identify high-risk patients early in the disease process, so  they can receive more aggressive blood pressure control and perhaps other  specific disease-modifying therapies, thus delaying or avoiding the onset of  cardiovascular disease. Cardiac biomarkers may have a unique role in the  prognostic evaluation of patients with hypertension as many cardiac biomarker  levels become abnormal long before the onset of overt cardiovascular disease.  This review will provide an overview of cardiac biomarkers that may be used to  predict future cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension."|"disease,cardiovascular,patients,cardiac,may"|"disease,cardiovascular,patients,cardiac,hypertension" 
"AB  - Two randomized studies were designed to assess the safety, tolerability and  efficacy of losartan 100 mg (L100) plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (H12.5) in a   single fixed-dose combination. In one study, subjects received losartan 50 mg  (L50) plus H12.5 during an 8-week filter period. They were then randomized to  either L100/H12.5 or L50/H12.5 for another 8 weeks, followed by L100/H12.5 for 44  weeks. The primary end point was safety of L100/H12.5 for 52 weeks. In the second  study, subjects received L100 during an 8-week filter period. Subjects were then   randomized to receive either L100/H12.5 or L100 for a further 8 weeks. The  primary end point was change from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure  (SiDBP) at week 8. Safety was assessed throughout both studies. L100/H12.5  reduced SiDBP and sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) at 8 weeks, and when  compared with L100, the differences were statistically significant for both  measures (P<0.001). L100/H12.5 reductions SiDBP for 8 weeks were comparable to  L50/H12.5. The efficacy of L100/H12.5 was maintained to week 52. Drug-related  adverse events with an incidence 2% in the L100/H12.5 group during the 52-week  extension period were an increase in aspartate aminotransferase and in blood uric  acid. Additionally, mean uric acid levels were reduced by 0.57 mg dl(-1) from  baseline with long-term treatment with L100/H12.5 in subjects whose baseline uric  acid level was >7.0 mg dl(-1). In conclusion, L100/H12.5 was shown to be more  effective than L100 at reducing SiDBP and SiSBP and showed good tolerability in  Japanese patients with essential hypertension."|"l100,h12,week,mg,sidbp"|"l100,h12,weeks,mg,week" 
"AB  - Whether changes over time of urinary albumin excretion have prognostic value is a  matter of discussion. The objective was to assess the prognostic value of changes  in urinary albumin excretion over time in cardiovascular risk during  antihypertensive treatment. Follow-up study of 2835 hypertensives in the absence   of previous cardiovascular disease (mean age 55 years, 47% men, BP 138/80 mm Hg,   19.1% diabetics, and calibrated systemic coronary risk estimation 5 or >10.6%).  Usual-care of antihypertensive treatment was implemented to maintain blood  pressure<140/90 mm Hg. Urinary albumin excretion was assessed yearly, and the  values were expressed as the creatinine ratio. Incidence of cardiovascular  events, fatal and nonfatal, was recorded during the follow-up. During a median  follow-up of 4.7 years (17 028 patients-year), 294 fatal and first nonfatal  cardiovascular events were recorded (1.73 CVD per 100 patients/year).  Independently of blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, level of  cardiovascular risk, and antihypertensive treatment, microalbuminuria at baseline  and at any time during the follow-up resulted in higher risk for events, hazard  ratio (HR) 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.79) and HR 1.49 (95% CI,  1.14-1.94), respectively. Likewise, development of microalbuminuria (HR 1.60; 95%  CI, 1.04-2.46) or persistence from the beginning (1.53; 95% CI, 1.13-2.06) had a   significantly higher rate of events than if remained normoalbuminuric (HR 1) or  regress to normoalbuminuria (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06) with an 18%, 18%, 8%,  and 11% events, respectively, P<0.001. The study supports the value of urinary  albumin excretion assessment as a prognostic factor for cardiovascular risk, but   also opens the way to consider it as an intermediate objective in hypertension."|"cardiovascular,risk,events,hr,albumin"|"cardiovascular,95,ci,events,hr" 
"AB  - Stem cells have great clinical significance in many cardiovascular diseases.  However, there are limited data regarding the involvement of mesenchymal stem  cells (MSCs) in the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension. The aim of this  study was to investigate the circulation of MSCs in patients with essential  hypertension. The authors included 24 patients with untreated essential  hypertension and 19 healthy individuals. Using flow cytometry, MSCs in peripheral  blood, as a population of CD45-/CD34-/CD90+ cells and also as a population of  CD45-/CD34-/CD105+ cells, were measured. The resulting counts were translated  into the percentage of MSCs in the total cells. Hypertensive patients were shown   to have increased circulating CD45-/CD34-/CD90+ compared with controls  (0.0069%+/-0.012% compared with 0.00085%+/-0.0015%, respectively; P=.039). No  significant difference in circulating CD45-/CD34-/CD105+ cells was found between   hypertensive patients' and normotensive patients' peripheral blood  (0.018%+/-0.013% compared with 0.015%+/-0.014%, respectively; P=.53). Notably,  CD45-/CD34-/CD90+ circulating cells were positively correlated with left  ventricular mass index (LVMI) (r=0.516, P<.001). Patients with essential  hypertension have increased circulating MSCs compared with normotensive patients,  and the number of MSCs is correlated with LVMI. These findings contribute to the   understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension and might suggest a future  therapeutic target."|"cells,mscs,hypertension,patients,cd34"|"cells,patients,mscs,cd34,cd45" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension which accounts 90-95% of the total hypertension cases is  affected by both genetic and environmental factors. This study was undertaken to   investigate the association of aldosterone synthase C-344T, angiotensin II type I  receptor A1166C and 11- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 G534A polymorphisms  with essential hypertension in the population of Odisha, India. A total of 246  hypertensive subjects (males, 159; females, 87) and 274 normal healthy  individuals (males, 158; females, 116) were enrolled in this study based on the  inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analysis of genetic and biochemical data  revealed that in this population the CT and TT genotypes of aldosterone synthase   C-344T polymorphism, frequency of alcohol consumption and aldosterone levels were  significantly high among the total as well as male hypertensives, while the AC  and CC genotypes of angiotensin II type I receptor A1166C polymorphism were  significantly high among the total as well as female hypertensives. High density   lipoprotein levels were higher in male hypertensives."|"total,aldosterone,population,genetic,study"|"total,aldosterone,high,hypertension,hypertensives" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell distribution (RDW) has been suggested to be associated with   cardiovascular mortality and mortality. However, few studies have yet  investigated the possible association between RDW and early-stage renal function   damage in patients with primary hypertension without receiving drug treatment.  Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate early-stage renal  function status in patients with RDW levels. RESULTS: The study included 513  primary hypertension patients (319 men and 194 women) without receiving drug  treatment. Significant positive correlation was observed between  albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and RDW in hypertensive patients (r = 0.531, P   < 0.001). In multivariate line regression analysis, night-time SBP (B = 0.042, P   < 0.001), ACR (B = 0.005, P < 0.001), and uric acid (B = 0.001, P = 0.022) were  positive predictors of RDW independent of age, sex, hemoglobin, and other  indexes, whereas daytime SBP (B = -0.019, P < 0.001) was inversely associated  with RDW. The receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC) explored the  relationship between renal function status and RDW, estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and high-sensitivity C-reactive  protein. The area under the curve was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85; P < 0.001), 0.45  (95% CI: 0.39-0.50; P = 0.049), 0.49 (95% CI: 0.43-0.54; P = 0.583), and 0.49  (95% CI: 0.44-0.55; P = 0.811), respectively. Using a cutoff point of 12.8, the  RDW predicted renal function status (ACR) with a sensitivity of 76% and a  specificity of 70%. CONCLUSION: RDW, as an easy and quick measurable index, can  predict early-stage renal function damage in essential hypertensive patients  without receiving drug treatment."|"rdw,renal,patients,function,acr"|"rdw,001,function,patients,renal" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-(1-7) modulates renal blood flow in humans with essential  hypertension by inducing vasodilation and counterbalancing angiotensin II-induced  vasoconstriction. Little is, however, known about the effects of  angiotensin-(1-7) in kidneys with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. We  previously demonstrated that the effect of angiotensin-(1-7) is reduced in  patients with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. As the  renin-angiotensin system is also activated in kidneys with renal artery stenosis,  we hypothesized that the vasodilatory effect of angiotensin-(1-7) is also reduced  in such kidneys. METHOD: Therefore, we selectively measured mean renal blood flow  ((1)(3)(3)Xenon washout method) before and during local infusion of  angiotensin-(1-7) (0.27, 0.9, and 2.7 ng/kg per min) in hypertensive patients who  were angiographically evaluated for the presence of renovascular abnormalities.  Data were analyzed in three groups: stenotic kidneys, nonstenotic kidneys with  renal artery stenosis of the contralateral kidney (contralateral stenotic  kidneys), or essentially hypertensive controls without renovascular abnormalities  (matched for urinary sodium excretion). RESULTS: Angiotensin-(1-7) infusion  resulted in an increase in renal blood flow in matched controls. In stenotic  kidneys however, the effect of angiotensin-(1-7) was significantly reduced as  compared to controls. The angiotensin-(1-7) effect in contralateral stenotic  kidneys was comparable to controls. CONCLUSION: Angiotensin-(1-7)-induced  vasodilation is reduced in stenotic kidneys, but not in contralateral stenotic  kidneys. This suggests that the altered blood flow regulation in kidneys with  atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a local phenomenon and not related to  generalized atherosclerotic burden. Probably, the renin-angiotensin system  activation, bioavailability of nitric oxide, and structural changes in the  stenotic kidney play a role in this phenomenon."|"angiotensin,kidneys,renal,stenotic,blood"|"angiotensin,kidneys,renal,stenotic,artery" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: We found impaired brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was  associated with the number of target organ damage (TOD) in 2007. The present  study investigated whether FMD predicted TOD progression in essential  hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent FMD was measured in 280   adults in 2007. At the third year of examination, 199 patients (mean age 62.5 +/-  9.5, men 59.3%) were approached for participation in our study. Patients were  divided into two groups: normal FMD group (FMD >/=10) and impaired FMD group (FMD  <10). In patients with 0-1 TOD at baseline, impaired FMD group (n = 65) led to  thicker intima-media thickness (P = 0.02), increased carotid-to-femoral pulse  wave velocity (P = 0.03), increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (P = 0.04)  and increased TOD number (P = 0.02), as compared with the normal FMD group (n =  59) at the end of the follow-up, even after adjusting for age and sex, whereas  the relationship did not exist in 2-4 TOD group at baseline. TOD number increase   was associated with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (beta = 0.180, P =  0.035), blood pressure control (beta = -0.277, P = 0.001), low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 0.234, P = 0.006) and baseline FMD (beta =  -0.168, P = 0.043) in stepwise multivariate regression analysis. FMD remained a  significant predictor of TOD number increase in multiple logistic regression  analysis after adjustment for several known risk factors (relative risk 0.92, 95%  confidence interval 0.85-0.99, P = 0.042, for each 1% increase in FMD).  CONCLUSION: FMD is a predictor of future TOD progression in low-risk essential  hypertensive patients, but has little predictive value in the late stage of TOD."|"fmd,tod,patients,number,group"|"fmd,tod,group,beta,number" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between ambulatory arterial stiffness  index (AASI) and other parameters derived from ambulatory blood pressure (BP)  monitoring, including dipping status, in patients with grade 1/grade 2  hypertension. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included baseline data from  Chinese outpatients enrolled into a previous study, who had clinic diastolic BP  of 90-109 mmHg and systolic BP <180 mmHg, had undergone 24-h ambulatory BP  monitoring and routine blood chemistry investigations, and had estimated  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data. RESULTS: Out of 120 patients screened, 87  were included. No significant difference in 24-h AASI was found between dippers  and nondippers. The 24-h AASI significantly correlated with age, systolic BP and   pulse pressure, and inversely correlated with 24-h diastolic BP variation and  eGFR. In dippers and nondippers, AASI correlated with daytime pulse pressure,  daytime diastolic BP variation and eGFR; in nondippers, AASI also correlated with  24-h systolic BP and 24-h pulse pressure. The 24-h AASI was significantly  associated with 24-h pulse pressure and daytime pulse pressure. CONCLUSION: In  patients with grade 1/grade 2 essential hypertension, AASI shows a significant  correlation with ambulatory pulse pressure."|"aasi,bp,pressure,ambulatory,pulse"|"24,bp,aasi,pressure,pulse" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: The polymorphic angiotensinogen (AGT) gene is one of the most  promising candidates for essential hypertension. The aim of this study was to  examine the association between the A-6G variant of the AGT gene and the blood  pressure response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in  hypertensive subjects. METHODS: Five hundred and nine mildly to moderately  hypertensive subjects received ACE inhibitors for six weeks after a two-week  run-in period. AGT genotyping was performed by direct polymerase chain reaction  amplification and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nucleotide sequencing from  peripheral blood. RESULTS: The AA genotype, AG genotype, and GG genotype were  present in 301 (59.1%), 186 (36.6%), and 22 (4.3%) of patients, respectively. As   compared with patients carrying the AA or AG genotype, those carrying the GG  genotype had significantly greater reductions in systolic blood pressure,  diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure (p=0.007,  0.014, 0.027 and 0.005, respectively). Moreover, stepwise multiple linear  regression analysis showed that the A-6G genotype was a significant predictor of   systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure reductions (p=0.040 and 0.019,  respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the A-6G variant of the AGT  gene may be an important determinant of interindividual variation in the response  to ACE inhibitors."|"blood,agt,pressure,genotype,gene"|"pressure,genotype,blood,agt,6g" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many studies have investigated the role of  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C polymorphisms   in essential hypertension (EH), but results are inconclusive. The purpose of this  meta-analysis was to clarify the effects of MTHFR C677T/A1298C polymorphisms on  the risk of EH. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant   studies published until January 2014. Data were extracted by two independent  authors. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess  the association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C polymorphisms and the risk of EH using  random effect models or fixed effect models. Finally,30 studies with 5207 cases  and 5383 controls were included for C677T polymorphism and 6 studies with 1009  cases and 994 controls were included for A1298C polymorphism. RESULTS:  Meta-analysis results indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism contributed to an  increased risk of EH (for T vs. C: OR=1.30, 95%CI=1.18-1.43; for TT+CT vs. CC:  OR=1.34, 95%CI=1.24-1.46; for TT vs. CC: OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.32-1.99; for TT vs.  CT+CC: OR=1.41, 95%CI=1.26-1.59). However, no significant association was  detected between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and the risk of EH. CONCLUSION: This  meta-analysis supports that MTHFR C677T polymorphism plays a role in developing  EH. MTHFR A1298C polymorphism may not be associated with an increased risk of EH.  Further large and well-designed studies are warranted to confirm these findings."|"eh,mthfr,c677t,studies,a1298c"|"eh,mthfr,a1298c,c677t,polymorphism" 
"AB  - To investigate the effect of stepwise paced breathing (PB) on pulse transit time   (PTT), we collected physiological signals of electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration  and arterial pulse wave during a procedure of stepwise PB, which consists of 6  different breathing rates changing in a protocol of 14.0-12.5-11.0-9.5-8.0-7.0  breath per minute (BPM), with each breathing rate lasting 3 minutes. Twenty two  healthy adults involved in this experiment and the change of PTT was analyzed  during the stepwise PB procedure. In our study, the PTT was measured by  calculating the time interval from the R-spike of the ECG to the peaks of the  second derivative of the arterial pulse wave. Ensemble empirical mode  decomposition (EEMD) was applied to PTT to decompose the signal into different  intrinsic mode function, and respiratory oscillation and trend component  (baseline) in PTT were further extracted. It was found that the respiratory  oscillations in the PTT increased with decreasing of the PB rate, and many of the  subjects (14 out of 22) showed the phenomena of PTT baseline increasing during  the stepwise PB procedure. The results indicated that the stepwise PB procedure  induced a high level of cardiovascular oscillation and produced an accumulative  effect of PTT baseline increase. As PTT is capable of predicting changes in BP  over a short period of time, increase of PTT baseline indicates the decrease of  blood pressure. The experiments showed that the stepwise PB procedure could  reduce blood pressure for most subjects. For future work, it is necessary to  develop certain indices differentiating the effectiveness of the stepwise PB  procedure on the PTT baseline change, and to test the effectiveness of this  stepwise PB procedure on blood pressure reduction for patients with essential  hypertension."|"ptt,pb,stepwise,procedure,baseline"|"ptt,pb,stepwise,procedure,baseline" 
"AB  - Genetic studies, including familial linkage analysis, candidate gene approach and  genome-wide association study, to some extent, have failed in detecting  confirmative susceptibility genes/loci for essential hypertension (EH) in the  general population. Previous genetic studies have suggested that differential  susceptibility to many metabolic diseases is due to different environmental  adaptation patterns during the out-of-Africa expansion, which provides a new  strategy for the genetic study of EH. In this review, we introduce the principle   and the latest progress of evolutionary study of susceptibility genes for EH.  Furthermore, our recent evolutionary screening for EH susceptible genes/loci in  Chinese Han population is also summarized. This review is expected to provide  useful information for future genetic studies of EH and many other diseases."|"eh,genetic,susceptibility,study,genes"|"eh,genetic,genes,studies,study" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cerebral function  imaging of acupuncture and sham acupuncture at Taichong (LR 3) in patients with  essential hypertension (EH) was observed to analyze central mechanism of Taichong  (LR 3) to treat EH. METHODS: Eighteen EH patients were divided into a twisting  acupuncture group (10 cases) and a sham acupuncture group (8 cases), which were  treated with twisting manipulation and sham acu- puncture at right Taichong (LR  3), respectively. The treatments were both given with 30-second manipulation and   30- second interval for totally 5 min. During the acupuncture, fMRI was adopted  to scan the cerebral function imaging of EH patients on resting state, and the  acquired data were analyzed with SPM2 module in Matlab software. RESULTS:  Acupunc- ture at Taichong (LR 3) in EH patients mainly increased opposite-side  oxygen consumption, which generally activated left anterior cingulated gyrus (BA   32), left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), left inferior temporal gyrus (BA 19),  left middle temporal gyrus (BA 37) and right anterior central gyrus (BA 6). The  activated areas were related to motor, vision and cognition of emotion.  Stimulation region of sham acupuncture mainly included right anterior cingulated   gyrus (BA 24), left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and left inferior frontal  gyrus (BA 7). CONCLUSION: The central mechanism of Tai- chong (LR 3) on  antihypertensive effect and symptom improvement is not in thalamus and medulla  that are traditionally believed to control blood pressure. Taichong (LR 3) could   activate anterior cingulated gyrus to regulate parasympathetic nerve and lower  blood pressure, and through anterior cingulated gyrus, the connection with the  surrounding areas is strengthened to improve the cognitive impairment caused by  long-term hypertension."|"lr,eh,taichong,acupuncture,gyrus"|"ba,gyrus,acupuncture,left,lr" 
"AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been potentially implicated in both human and  experimental hypertension. We performed the mutational analysis of tRNA(Lys) gene  by PCR amplification and subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR fragments from  990 Chinese essential hypertensive subjects. We also made a comparative analysis   of the collected data of the essential hypertension subjects who carried  tRNA(Lys) mutation and those who did not carry the mutation using the methods of   1:1 case-control study. We totally found 7 mutation sites in 10 subjects. The  onset ages of the individuals carrying the mutation were earlier than those who  did not bear them. The level of blood urea nitrogen in hypertension subjects who   carried tRNA(Lys) mutation was higher than the hypertension subjects who did not   carried tRNA(Lys) mutation, while the serum potassium was significantly lower.  The level of platelet count in hypertension subjects who carried tRNA(Lys)  mutation was lower. The level of ventricular septal thickness in hypertension  subjects who carried tRNA(Lys) mutation was higher and the level of left  ventricular end diastolic diameter in hypertension subjects was significantly  lower. Mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) mutations might result in the change of their  structure and function, and then damaged the blood metabolism, the balance of the  blood electrolyte, the steady-state of the blood cells and the heart structure  and function, which were involved in the progress of the essential hypertension.   Part of the essential hypertension patients clinically presented the characters  of maternal inheritance, which might be associated with the tRNA(Lys) mutation."|"hypertension,subjects,mutation,trna,lys"|"hypertension,mutation,lys,subjects,trna" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used to treat  hypertension in many countries. Partial agonist act by stimulating beta receptors  when they are quiescent and blocking beta receptors when they are active. The  blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been  quantified. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the dose-related effects of various partial  agonists beta blockers on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure  (DBP) and heart rate versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension. SEARCH  METHODS: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process,  EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October  2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched  for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized  double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies must  contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm with fixed dose. Patients enrolled into  the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP >  140/90 mmHg). Duration of studies must be between three to 12 weeks. DATA  COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (GW and HB) confirmed the inclusion of  studies and extracted the data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen randomized  double-blinded placebo-controlled trials that examined the blood pressure  lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were  included in this review. Five of the included studies were parallel studies and  the other eight were cross-over studies. The overall risk of bias is high in this  review due to the small sample size and high risk of detection bias. Pindolol,  celiprolol and alprenolol lowered SBP and DBP compared to placebo. Acebutolol  lowered SBP but there was no clear evidence that it lowered DBP. There was no  clear evidence that pindolol and oxprenolol lowered SBP or DBP. Other than for  celiprolol, sample sizes were generally small increasing the uncertainty in  findings for individual agents versus placebo. In patients with moderate to  severe hypertension, partial agonists (considered as a subclass) lowered peak BP   by an average of 8 mmHg systolic (95% CI, -10 to -6, very low quality evidence),   4 mmHg diastolic (95%CI, -5 to -3, very low quality evidence) and reduced heart  rate by five beats per minute (95%CI, -6 to -4, very low quality evidence).  Higher dose partial agonists did not appear to provide additional BP lowering  effects compared to lower dose. The maximum BP lowering effect of the overall  subclass occurred at the starting dose. Partial agonists reduced pulse pressure  by 4 mmHg (95% CI, -5 to -2, very low evidence). Only one study reported  withdrawal due to adverse effects, the risk ratio (95% confidence interval) was  0.72 (0.07, 7.67). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was very low quality evidence that  in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists lowered peak  BP by an average of 8/4 mmHg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute.  There was no evidence of a greater effect at doses higher than the initial doses.  This estimate was probably exaggerated as it was subject to a high risk of bias.   Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane  reviews on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin  receptor blockers (ARBs), which also used similar inclusion criteria as this  review, the BP lowering effect appeared to be less than the effect in patients  with mild to moderate elevated BP who were taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs based  on an indirect comparison. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were only reported   in one trial so it is impossible to assess the harm of these drugs.

"AB  - Renalase, a novel monoamine oxidase, is emerging as an important regulator of  cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal diseases. However, the mechanism of  transcriptional regulation of this enzyme remains largely unknown. We undertook a  systematic analysis of the renalase gene to identify regulatory promoter elements  and transcription factors. Computational analysis coupled with transfection of  human renalase promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids (5'-promoter-deletion  constructs) into various cell types (HEK-293, IMR32, and HepG2) identified two  crucial promoter domains at base pairs -485 to -399 and -252 to -150.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using renalase promoter oligonucleotides  with and without potential binding sites for transcription factors Sp1, STAT3,  and ZBP89 displayed formation of specific complexes with HEK-293 nuclear  proteins. Consistently, overexpression of Sp1, STAT3, and ZBP89 augmented  renalase promoter activity; additionally, siRNA-mediated downregulation of Sp1,  STAT3, and ZBP89 reduced the level of endogenous renalase transcription as well  as the transfected renalase promoter activity. In addition, chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays showed in vivo interactions of these transcription  factors with renalase promoter. Interestingly, renalase promoter activity was  augmented by nicotine and catecholamines; while Sp1 and STAT3 synergistically  activated the nicotine-induced effect, Sp1 appeared to enhance epinephrine-evoked  renalase transcription. Moreover, renalase transcript levels in mouse models of  human essential hypertension were concomitantly associated with endogenous STAT3   and ZBP89 levels, suggesting crucial roles for these transcription factors in  regulating renalase gene expression in cardiovascular pathological conditions."|"renalase,promoter,transcription,stat3,sp1"|"renalase,promoter,transcription,sp1,stat3"

The emotional sphere in adolescents with  hypertension was characterized by increased anxiety in combination with emotional  lability, tendency to depression, and aggressive reactions. The most meaningful  parameters describing significant differences between the groups of healthy and  hypertensive patients in parameters of LPO-antioxidant protection system were  fatty acids with double bonds, antioxidant activity, and retinol.

"AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common polymorphisms in the   C-terminus of SCNN1B gene encoding the beta-subunit of epithelial sodium channel   are associated with essential hypertension (EH) in Chinese hypertensive families.  A total of 433 subjects from 102 EH families were recruited. Biochemical and  anthropometric indices and systematic screening of the C-terminus of SCNN1B were   performed. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Homozygotes  for the common A allele at rs3743966 had on average a 12.06 mmHg higher SBP and a  7.43 mmHg higher DBP than homozygotes for the rarer T allele. AA + AT genotype of  rs3743966 was also found to maybe a risk factor of hypertension by logistic  regression and transmission/disequilibrium test. AA + AT genotype of rs3743966  maybe a risk factor of EH.

"AB  - Pulsatile components of blood pressure may arise from forward (ventricular  generated) or backward wave travel in the arterial tree. The objective of this  study was to determine the relative contributions of forward and backward waves  to pulsatility. We used wave intensity and wave separation analysis to determine   pulsatile components of blood pressure during inotropic and vasopressor  stimulation by dobutamine and norepinephrine in normotensive subjects and  compared pulse pressure components in hypertensive (mean+/-SD, 48.8+/-11.3 years;  165+/-26.6/99+/-14.2 mm Hg) and normotensive subjects (52.2+/-12.6 years;  120+/-14.2/71+/-8.2 mm Hg). Dobutamine (7.5 mug/kg per minute) increased the  forward compression wave generated by the ventricle and increased pulse pressure   from 36.8+/-3.7 to 59.0+/-3.4 mm Hg (mean+/-SE) but had no significant effect on   mean arterial pressure or the midsystolic backward compression wave. By contrast,  norepinephrine (50 ng/kg per minute) had no significant effect on the forward  compression wave but increased the midsystolic backward compression wave. Despite  this increase in the backward compression wave, and an increase in mean arterial   pressure, norepinephrine increased central pulse pressure less than dobutamine  (increases of 22.1+/-3.8 and 7.2+/-2.8 mm Hg for dobutamine and norepinephrine,  respectively; P<0.02). An elevated forward wave component (mean+/-SE, 50.4+/-3.4   versus 35.2+/-1.8 mm Hg, in hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively;  P<0.001) accounted for approximately two thirds of the total difference in  central pulse pressures between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Increased  central pulse pressure during inotropic stimulation and in essential hypertension  results primarily from the forward compression wave."|"wave,pressure,forward,mean,pulse"|"wave,pressure,compression,forward,backward" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Arterial stiffness is an independent cardiovascular risk factor.  Aging, high blood pressure and increased renin-angiotensin system activity  contribute to increased arterial stiffness in patients with atherosclerotic  renovascular hypertension (aRVH). A literature search failed to identify any  study related to this topic. Therefore, our aim was to determine the arterial  stiffness in patients with aRVH and analyze whether stenting in addition to  multifactorial drug therapy has beneficial effects on markers of stiffness and  the clinical course. METHODS: In this 6-month longitudinal study, 37 patients  with refractory hypertension and unilateral aRVH were enrolled. After stenting,  all patients received multifactorial dug therapy including 80 mg of telmisartan.   Arterial stiffness indices were determined using Arteriograph. The control group   consisted of 44 patients with essential hypertension. RESULTS: There were no  differences in brachial blood pressure values between the two groups (P > 0.05).   At baseline, adjusted pulse wave velocity (PWV) was higher in aRVH patients than   that of essential hypertensive patients (12.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.6 +/- 0.3 m/s; P =  0.029). In the aRVH group, at the end of the follow-up, a significant decrease in  the aortic augmentation index (37.7 +/- 9.9 vs. 33.7 +/- 11.4; P = 0.02) without   changes in PWV was observed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to  show that arterial stiffness is higher in patients with refractory aRVH than in  those with essential hypertension. Multifactorial therapy based on stenting and  intensive medical treatment reduced central blood pressure and augmentation  index. Failure to obtain PWV reduction is likely a consequence of the present  irreversible structural vessel changes.

"AB  - It was determined the characteristics of lipid status of patients with essential   hypertension, abdominal obesity with concomitant subclinical  hypothyroidism--mostly increased levels of total and LDL cholesterol. In  assessing the effectiveness of statin therapy in combination with levothyroxine  replacement therapy compared with statin monotherapy, combination therapy showed   the best result in terms of achievement of target levels of both total  cholesterol and LDL. The obtained results allow us to recommend the use of  combination therapy for patients with hypertension, abdominal obesity with  concomitant subclinical hypothyroidism in order to achieve the target values of  LDL and thus to reduce the cardiovascular risk of these patients."|"therapy,combination,ldl,patients,target"|"therapy,combination,ldl,patients,abdominal" 
"AB  - We explored the interaction of 6 candidate genetic mutations in essential  hypertension (EH). The mutations AGT M235T, ACE I/D, eNOS Glu298Asp, ET-2 A985G,   ANP T2238C, and NPRC A-55C were detected using a genechip microarray in 100  patients with EH and 97 controls from the Han population living in the Yunnan  Province of China. Risks of EH were evaluated with respect to a combination of  these genotypes. Interactions were analyzed using multifactor dimensionality  reduction (MDR). P values were corrected using Bonferroni's adjustment. Results  showed that CC genotype frequencies for NPRC A-55C (0.540) in EH were  significantly higher than those in controls (0.237, Pc < 0.01; odds ratio (OR) =   3.777; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.050-6.960). The OR for NPRC A-55C CC  combined with ET-2 A985G GG increased to 4.673 and to 5.529 when the MT genotype   of AGT M235T, the EE genotype of eNOS Glu298Asp, the GG genotype of ET-2 A985G,  and the CC genotype of NPRC A-55C were combined. MDR showed that ET-2/NPRC is the  best model (OR = 4.002; 95%CI = 2.1597-7.4159). The CC genotype for NPRC A-55C  and the G allele for ET-2 A985G were associated with susceptibility to EH.  Although the contributions of the candidate genes differ, they may have  cooperative effects on conferring risk for EH. Moreover, potential gene-gene  interactions were found between ET-2 A985G and NPRC A-55C in EH."|"eh,et,nprc,c,genotype"|"eh,nprc,55c,et,genotype" 
"AB  - Over recent years, a considerable increase in the popularity of cryostimulation  and whole body cryotherapy (WBC) procedures has occurred both among healthy  individuals and in various groups of patients, including those with primary  untreated hypertension. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of WBC  on the functional parameters of cardiovascular system in normotensive and  primarily hypertensive individuals. The study included 26 young male volunteers  with normal blood pressure range (NormoBP) and 13 with essential arterial  hypertension (HyperBP). Each subject was exposed to cryotherapeutic factor  (whole-body cryotherapy/cryostimulation, WBC) at a temperature of approximately  -115 degrees C to -125 degrees C for a period of 3 min. The cardiovascular and  autonomic parameters were measured noninvasively with Task Force(R) Monitor.  Measurements in a supine position and tilt test were performed "before WBC" and  "after WBC". Our study revealed that cryogenic temperatures exert strong  modulatory effect on the cardiovascular system. Both groups showed adaptive  changes of myocardial and vascular parameters in response to rapid cooling of  virtually the whole body surface. While the profiles of some of these changes  were similar in both the groups, also several considerable intergroup differences  were documented. Consequently, the cryostimulation and cryotherapy treatment  should be prescribed carefully to individuals who present with cardiovascular  failure of any degree."|"wbc,cardiovascular,parameters,individuals,groups"|"wbc,cardiovascular,body,cryostimulation,cryotherapy" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the CX 37 1019C/T polymorphism   and the susceptibility to essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: A total of 1126  control group consisted of 874 healthy people, i.e., non-EH patients. All cases  were genotyped by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Polymorphism C1019T on the Connexin37   gene was found in the whole population. The distribution of three genotype  frequencies in both groups was in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  The frequency of the CX37C allele was higher in EH patients (57.4% vs. 42.1%,  chi(2)=92.5, P<0.01) compared to the control group. The frequency of C carriers  (CC+TC) was 80.5% in EH patients compared to 66.7% in the control (chi(2)=49.0,  P<0.01). EH risk was significantly increased in carriers of C the allele (CC+TC)   over that in the TT homozygote (OR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.68 approximately 2.52).  Subsequent stratified analyses demonstrate that a significant difference exists  in the frequency of C carriers between male EH patients and controls (79.2% vs.  69.1%, chi(2)=13.4, P<0.01) and in female EH patients and the control group  (81.8% vs. 64.4%, chi(2)=38.7, P<0.01). The carriers of the C allele had higher  EH risk compared with the TT homozygote without sex differences (male: OR=1.71,  95% CI: 1.28 approximately 2.27; female: OR=2.48, 95%CI: 1.85 approximately  3.31).

"AB  - Several studies suggest a link between autoimmunity and essential hypertension in  humans. However, whether autoimmunity can drive the development of hypertension  remains unclear. The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus is  characterized by autoantibody production, and the prevalence of hypertension is  increased markedly in this patient population compared with normal healthy women.  We hypothesized that preventing the development of autoimmunity would prevent the  development of hypertension in a mouse model of lupus. Female lupus (NZBWF1) and   control mice (NZW) were treated weekly with anti-CD20 or immunoglobulin G  antibodies (both 10 mg/kg, IV) starting at 20 weeks of age for 14 weeks.  Anti-CD20 therapy markedly attenuated lupus disease progression as evidenced by  reduced CD45R+ B cells and lower double-stranded DNA autoantibody activity. In  addition, renal injury in the form of urinary albumin, glomerulosclerosis, and  tubulointerstitial fibrosis, as well as tubular injury (indicated by renal  cortical expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) was prevented   by anti-CD20 therapy in lupus mice. Finally, lupus mice treated with anti-CD20  antibody did not develop hypertension. The protection against the development of   hypertension was associated with lower renal cortical tumor necrosis factor-alpha  expression, a cytokine that has been previously reported by us to contribute to  the hypertension in this model, as well as renal cortical monocyte  chemoattractant protein-1 expression and circulating T cells. These data suggest   that the development of autoimmunity and the resultant increase in renal  inflammation are an important underlying factor in the prevalent hypertension  that occurs during systemic lupus erythematosus."|"hypertension,renal,lupus,development,autoimmunity"|"hypertension,lupus,development,renal,anti" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Marked interpatient variability exists in the blood pressure response  to carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker. Here we evaluated the influence of 4   common polymorphisms in genes of the beta-adrenergic receptor on the  antihypertensive efficacy of carvedilol in patients in a double-blinded  monotherapy study. METHODS: Eighty-seven subjects with uncomplicated essential  hypertensive (49% men; age = 52.2 +/- 11.1 years) from Jilin province of China  were enrolled in the study, and 5 of them discontinued the treatment due to  adverse effects. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) were measured  before and after 7 days of treatment with carvedilol (10 mg/d). Genotypes of the   beta1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1 Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly) and beta2-adrenergic  receptor (ADRB2 Gly16Arg and Glu27Gln) were determined by polymerase chain  reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Patients  homozygous for ADRB1 Arg389 had an approximately 4-fold greater reduction in DBPs  than those homozygous for ADRB1 Gly389 (10.61 vs. 2.62 mm Hg, P = 0.013). The  ADRB1 haplotype was also a significant predictor of response, as patients with  the Gly49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 haplotype pair had a 5.7-fold greater reduction in  DBPs than those homozygous for the Ser49Gly389 haplotype (16.11 vs. 2.83 mm Hg, P  = 0.0055). An association was not found between ADRB2 polymorphism and carvedilol  responsiveness in antihypertensive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the   first evidence to support that ADRB1 polymorphisms play an important role in the   DBPs response to carvedilol treatment in patients with essential hypertension.

"AB  - The authors examined the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR), calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration  creatinine-cystatin C equation, and hemodynamics in 556 normotensive or  never-treated hypertensive patients without kidney disease (mean age, 46 years).   Hemodynamic variables were recorded using pulse wave analysis and whole-body  impedance cardiography. The mean eGFR was 98 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (range, 64-145  mL/min/1.73 m(2) and one third of the patients had values below 92, while none  had proteinuria. In linear regression analyses adjusted for differences in age,  weight:height ratio, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and sex, significant  associations were found between lower eGFR and higher systolic (P=.001) and  diastolic blood pressure (P<.001) and higher systemic vascular resistance  (P=.001). There was no association between eGFR and cardiac output or  extracellular volume. In the absence of clinical kidney disease, lower eGFR was  associated with higher blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance.  Therefore, early impairment in kidney function may be involved in the  pathogenesis of essential hypertension."|"egfr,kidney,disease,using,age"|"egfr,kidney,001,disease,higher" 
"AB  - An association exists between hyperaldosteronism, hypertension and impaired  insulin action. Eplerenone is a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist;   however, little is known about its effects on insulin action. The aim of this  study was to determine the effect of eplerenone on insulin action in hypertensive  adults, using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp. A randomised, controlled,   double-blind, crossover design was employed. After a 6-week washout period,  hypertensive, non-diabetic patients were treated with either eplerenone 25 mg  twice daily or doxazosin 2 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. After each treatment  period, insulin action was assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp,  with isotope dilution methodology. After washout, treatment groups were crossed  over. Fifteen patients completed the study. There were no differences in fasting   glucose, or fasting insulin between treatment with eplerenone or doxazosin. The  measure of overall insulin sensitivity, exogenous glucose infusion rates during  the last 30 min of the clamp, was similar with both treatments; 23.4 (3.9) mumol   kg(-1) min(-1) after eplerenone and 23.3 (3.6) mumol kg(-1) min(-1) after  doxazosin (P=0.83). Isotopically determined fasting endogenous glucose production  rates were similar after both treatments (eplerenone 9.4 (0.6) mumol kg(-1)  min(-1) vs doxazosin 10.6 (0.7) mumol kg(-1) min(-1)). There was a trend for  lower endogenous glucose production rates during hyperinsulinaemia following  eplerenone compared with doxazosin (2.0 (0.8) mumol kg(-1) min(-1) vs 4.1 (0.9)  mumol kg(-1) min(-1)). There was no difference in insulin stimulated peripheral  glucose utilisation rates after treatment with eplerenone or doxazosin (25.4  (3.6) mumol kg(-1) min(-1) vs 27.0 (3.9) mumol kg(-1) min(-1)). This study gives   reassuring evidence of the neutral effect of eplerenone on insulin action in  hypertensive, non-diabetic patients."|"insulin,eplerenone,action,glucose,min"|"eplerenone,min,insulin,kg,mumol" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is characterised by increased thrombotic tendency and  impaired fibrinolytic activity. However, exercise-induced changes in coagulation   and fibrinolysis have not yet been clarified. We aimed at determining thrombotic   and fibrinolytic activity during exercise in patients with EH pre and post  treatment with an Angiotensin II receptor blocker. Study 1 consisted of 30  untreated hypertensive (UH) and 15 normotensive (NT) individuals. The UH  individuals who received treatment were included in study 2 and were followed up   after a 3-month treatment period with valsartan. Thrombin-antithrombin (TAT)  complexes and human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured as  markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis, respectively, at baseline, immediately  after a treadmill exercise test and 30 min later. In UH, TAT and PAI-1 levels  were significantly increased immediately after peak exercise and decreased 30 min  later, as compared with baseline levels. At all time points, UH exhibited  significantly higher TAT and PAI-1 levels compared with NT. No significant  changes of TAT and PAI-1 levels were observed in NT and in patients post  treatment. Acute high-intensity exercise results in impaired thrombotic and  fibrinolytic response in untreated patients with EH. Angiotensin II receptor  blockade with adequate blood pressure control greatly improves exercise-induced  changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis in EH."|"exercise,treatment,pai,eh,tat"|"exercise,eh,levels,pai,tat" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on patient-relevant  outcomes and blood pressure was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of  stress-reduction techniques in adults with essential hypertension. METHODS:  Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified as  part of a systematic search in six electronic databases ending September 2012.  RCTs comparing stress-reduction techniques versus no such techniques with a  follow-up of at least 24 weeks and published in English or German were included.   Outcomes of interest were death, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, end-stage  renal disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events, changes in blood  pressure, and changes in antihypertensive medication. When appropriate,  meta-analyses were used to combine data. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs analyzing  different stress-reduction techniques such as biofeedback, relaxation or combined  interventions were identified. Data were not reported for most of the  patient-relevant outcomes, and meta-analyses could only be used to evaluate  effects on blood pressure. The data indicated a blood pressure-lowering effect,  but the studies had methodological shortcomings and heterogeneity between them  was high. Mean group differences for DBP ranged from -10 to 1 mmHg and for SBP  from -12 to 10 mmHg. In terms of antihypertensive medication, no favorable  effects of stress-reduction techniques could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: The  available RCTs on stress-reduction techniques used for at least 24 weeks appeared  to indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect in patients with essential  hypertension, but this should be interpreted with caution because of major  methodological limitations. A benefit of specific stress-reduction techniques in   hypertensive patients remains unproven."|"techniques,stress,reduction,blood,pressure"|"techniques,reduction,stress,blood,pressure" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary aldosteronism, an important form of secondary hypertension, is  associated with significant increase of cardiovascular risk (ischaemic heart,  cerebrovascular events, arrhythmias) (relative risk 4.6). The specific treatment   of primary aldosteronism significantly reduces cardiovascular risk. In addition  to high blood pressure values and direct action of aldosterone, new mechanisms  such as increased oxidative stress are involved in the development of organ  damage, metabolic, endothelial and coagulation complications. METHODS: The aim of  the study was to evaluate parameters of oxidative stress in 38 patients (21 men,   17 women, mean age 53.3 +/- 4.7 years) with primary aldosteronism [11  aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) (4 men, 7 women, mean age 50.2 +/- 4.5 years)  and 27 idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (IHA) (17 men, 10 women, mean age 54.5 +/-   5.3 years)] at diagnosis and after specific treatment (surgical or  pharmacological), with respect to 50 patients with essential hypertension (26  men, 24 women, mean age 49 +/- 7.4 years) and 50 healthy individuals (28 men, 22   women, mean age 48.7 +/- 4.4 years). RESULTS: Patients with primary aldosteronism  showed significant increase of NADPH oxidase (Nox2-dp) plasma levels and urinary   isoprostanes (34.9 +/- 4.3 mug/dl and 216.3 +/- 15.7 ng/mg, respectively; P <  0.05) than essential hypertensive patients (27.1 +/- 3.7 mug/dl and 144.8 +/- 9.4  ng/mg, respectively; P < 0.05). In APA patients undergoing adrenalectomy, we  observed significant reduction of both circulating levels of Nox2-dp (29 +/- 2.1   vs. 22,4 +/- 1.7 mug/dl; P < 0.05) and urinary levels of isoprostanes (221.1 +/-   10.5 vs. 132.6 +/- 8.7 ng/mg; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study  showing an increased oxidative stress in primary aldosteronism, characterized by   increased serum levels of Nox2-dp and urinary excretion of isoprostanes. After  APA removal with laparoscopic adrenalectomy, we found reduction of serum Nox2-dp   and urinary isoprostanes."|"aldosteronism,primary,patients,significant,risk"|"age,aldosteronism,mean,men,patients" 
"AB  - RATIONALE: Hypertension associates with sudden cardiac death, its relationship  with ventricular arrhythmias being demonstrated by multiple studies, an increased  dispersion of repolarization being an important arrhythmogenesis mechanism. Only   a small percentage of hypertensive patients presents increased blood pressure  values exclusively as risk factor, most of them presenting additional risk  factors that reinforce each other leading to increased total cardiovascular risk.  AIM: to analyze the dispersion of repolarization parameters (QT interval, QT  dispersion, Tpeak-Tend interval (Tpe), Tpe/QT, Tpe dispersion) in relation to  cardiovascular risk factors, as well as total cardiovascular risk estimated by  SCORE model, in mild to moderate essential hypertension. METHOD: 62 consecutive  patients, mean age 55+/-11 years, were evaluated by 24 hours Holter  electrocardiography monitoring. Manual measurement of dispersion of  repolarization parameters was performed. RESULTS: Based on SCORE model, 33.9%  patients presented low risk, 40.3% moderate risk, 16.1% high risk and 9.1% very  high risk. Age had a positive correlation with QT and reverse correlations with  QT dispersion, Tpe and Tpe/QT in lead V1. Tpe/QT showed significantly higher  values in men versus women. Glucose metabolism disorders associated with higher  values of QT and Tpe dispersion were present. However, dispersion of  repolarization parameters was similar between risk categories assessed by SCORE  model, Tpe in lead V3 correlated significantly with SCORE score. CONCLUSIONS: In   mild to moderate hypertension, the dispersion of repolarization parameters is  influenced by age, gender and glucose metabolism disorders. Among these, Tpe in  lead V3 correlates with total cardiovascular risk assessed by SCORE model."|"dispersion,risk,tpe,repolarization,qt"|"risk,dispersion,tpe,qt,score" 
"AB  - This study aims to detect early changes of kidney in patients with primary  hypertension by 3.0 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 26 patients  with primary hypertension (hypertension group) and 33 healthy volunteers (control  group) underwent conventional and functional magnetic resonance scans, which  included blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI, diffusion weighted imaging  (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We measured renal cortical thickness  (CT), parenchymal thickness (PT), and functional values of renal cortex and  medulla including R2* value, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and  fractional anisotropy (FA) value in each group, and then calculated the  cortical/parenchymal thickness ratio (CPR). Compared with those in the control  group, CT and CPR in hypertension group were larger (P < 0.01), cortical and  medullar R2* values increased (P < 0.01) whereas medullar FA values decreased (P   < 0.05). It could be well concluded that noninvasive 3.0 T functional MRI would  have important clinical significance in identifying early abnormalities of kidney  in hypertension patients."|"functional,group,hypertension,diffusion,cortical"|"group,hypertension,functional,cortical,diffusion" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of olmesartan medoxomil tablets (olmesartan) in  comparison with Olmetec on 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) and blood  pressure variability (BPV) in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.  METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, double-mimic controlled trial was  performed.Forty-eight patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were   randomly into treatment group (olmesartan) and control group (Olmetec) for eight   weeks. The ABPM was taken before and at the end of the trial. RESULTS: After  eight weeks, treatment with olmesartan induced a significant reduction in ABPM in  patients [(9 +/- 3)/(11 +/- 3) mmHg(1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa)], which is similar with  the reduction by Olmetec [(9 +/- 4)/(9 +/- 5) mmHg], P > 0.05. This situation  holds for BPV with the standard deviations of 24 h, systolic blood  pressure/diastolic blood pressure of pre-treatment and pro-treatment were (10 +/-  2)/(11 +/- 3) mmHg vs (10 +/- 3)/(12 +/- 2) mmHg in olmesartan group, and (10 +/-  3)/(11 +/- 3) mmHg vs (12 +/- 3)/(12 +/- 4) mmHg in Olmetec group. (3) There is  no difference in the rate of adverse event between olmesartan (10.42%) and  Olmetec (8.33%) treatment (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Similar to Olmetec, treatment  with olmesartan once daily can significantly reduce ABPM in patients with mild to  moderate essential hypertension."|"olmesartan,olmetec,treatment,abpm,patients"|"mmhg,olmesartan,olmetec,treatment,10" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), a traditional natural herbal product, is  often used in the treatment of essential hypertension (EH) as complementary  therapy in China and European countries. AIM: To critically assess the current  clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of GBE for EH. METHODS: 7 electronic  databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, VIP, CBM, Wanfang data, and CNKI)  were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GBE for EH.  Methodological quality was assessed independently using the Cochrane Handbook for  Systematic Reviews of Interventions. RESULTS: A total of 9 RCTs with 1012  hypertensive patients were identified and reviewed. Most RCTs were of high risk  of bias with flawed study design and poor methodological quality. 6 trials  demonstrated potential positive effect of GBE as complementary therapy on BP  reduction when compared with antihypertensive drug therapy; however, it was not  associated with a statistically significant effect on both SBP and DBP reduction   in 3 other trials. Despite the positive findings, there were so many  methodological limitations and significant clinical heterogeneity. Most of the  trials did not report adverse effects, and the safety of GBE is still uncertain.   CONCLUSION: No confirmative conclusions on the efficacy and safety of GBE for EH   could be drawn. More rigorous trials are warranted to support their clinical use."|"gbe,trials,eh,methodological,rcts"|"gbe,trials,eh,clinical,methodological" 
"AB  - This study aimed to investigate the influence of acute glycemic load on vascular   endothelial function in patients with hypertension and to evaluate the protective  effect of vitamins C and E during the acute glycemic phase. We randomly selected   39 hypertensive patients and 21 normal subjects and divided them into 3 groups:  75 g oral glucose (glycemic load group), 75 g glucose+0.9 g vitamin C (VC group),  75 g glucose+2 g vitamin C+0.8 g vitamin E (VC+VE group). Extravascular color  Doppler ultrasound was used to detect brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation   at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h, and, at the same time, serum anti-oxidant products were  measured. Basic endothelial functions in patients with hypertension were  decreased in the glycemic load group (9.48+/-3.33 versus 13.09+/-6.78%, P<0.05),   and was even more depressed in the hypertensive group (9.48+/-3.33 versus  14.20+/-6.48%, P<0.05). Antioxidant vitamins played a dose-dependent protective  role on acute damage of endothelial function due to glycemic load. Acute high  blood sugar damaged vascular endothelial functions, especially in hypertensive  patients, but this effect can be reversed by large doses of vitamin C and E."|"glycemic,acute,patients,endothelial,group"|"glycemic,group,acute,endothelial,load" 
"AB  - AIM: In essential hypertension (EH), the regulation of renal sodium excretion is   aberrant. We hypothesized that in mild EH, (i) abnormal dynamics of plasma renin   concentration (PRC) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are responsible for the   exaggerated natriuresis, and (ii) exosomic protein patterns reflect the renal  tubular abnormality involved in the dysregulation of sodium excretion. METHODS:  After 2-week drug washout and 4-day diet, systemic and renal hemodynamics,  cardio-renal hormones, glomerular filtration and renal excretion were studied in   male patients during saline loading (SL). Excretion rates of exosome-related  urinary proteins including apical membrane transporters were determined by  proteomics-based methods. RESULTS: In patients, baseline renal vascular  conductance was reduced (-44%, P < 0.001), but non-renal vascular conductances  were normal while PRC was reduced and ANP elevated (both P < 0.01). SL induced  exaggerated natriuresis and reduced PRC (P < 0.01), at normal suppression rate.  SL increased arterial pressure in patients (+11 mmHg, P < 0.001), but not in  controls; however, during time control, patients showed identical increases (+10   mmHg, P < 0.005) apparently dissociating arterial pressure from natriuresis. At  baseline, excretion rates of 438 proteins ranged from 0.07 to 49.8 pmol (mmol  creatinine)(-1); 12 proteins were found in all subjects, and 21 proteins were  found in two or more patients, but not in controls. In patients, the excretion  rate of retinoic acid-induced gene 2 protein was reduced, and excretion rates of   other proteins showed increased variances compatible with pathophysiological and   clinical applicability. CONCLUSION: Essential hypertension patients exhibit  selective renal vasoconstriction and individually varying excretion rates of  several exosome-related proteins. Hormonal changes, rather than arterial  pressure, seem to cause exaggeration of natriuresis."|"excretion,renal,patients,proteins,natriuresis"|"excretion,renal,patients,proteins,natriuresis" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is well known that exercise alleviates aortic remodeling and  preserves endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).  However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to   investigate the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in  exercise-induced attenuation of aortic remodeling and improvement of endothelial   function in an animal model of human essential hypertension. METHODS: The  10-week-old male SHR and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were given  moderate-intensity exercise for 12weeks (four groups, n=80-86 in each group).  RESULTS: In this work, exercise training reduced blood pressure and effectively  attenuated aortic remodeling, marked by a reduction in aortic weight/length, wall  thickness, and aortic levels of elastin and hydroxyproline, and improved  endothelium-mediated vascular relaxations of aortas in response to acetylcholine.  Exercise training in SHR reduced angiotensin II (AngII) levels and enhanced  Ang-(1-7) levels in aortas. Exercise training in SHR suppressed aortic  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) messenger  RNA (mRNA) levels and protein expression and up-regulated ACE2, AngII type 2  receptor, and Mas mRNA levels and protein expression. In addition, exercise  training in SHR increased levels of microRNA-27a (targeting ACE) and microRNA-155  (targeting AT1R) and decreased levels of microRNA-143 (targeting ACE2) in the  aortas. CONCLUSION: Chronic aerobic exercise training improved RAS balance in the  aortas, which may in part explain the protective effect of exercise on aortic  function and structure. SUMMARY: Chronic aerobic exercise training improved RAS  balance in the aortas, which may explain the protective effect of exercise on  aortic function and structure, at least in part."|"exercise,aortic,levels,training,aortas"|"exercise,aortic,levels,training,aortas" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between aldosterone and cardiac  diastolic dysfunction. DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 patients   with primary aldosteronism (PA) and 22 patients with essential hypertension (EH).  Plasma aldosterone concentration, plasma renin activity, and 24-h urine  aldosterone level were measured. Echocardiography, including tissue Doppler image  recordings, was performed. RESULTS: PA patients had a significantly higher left  ventricular (LV) mass index and worse LV diastolic function than those in EH  patients. Among various measures of aldosterone, log-transformed 24-h urine  aldosterone level had the most consistent correlation with diastolic function.  CONCLUSIONS: Aldosterone is strongly associated with LV diastolic dysfunction.  Twenty-four hour urine aldosterone is a good indicator to evaluate the impact of   aldosterone on LV diastolic function."|"aldosterone,diastolic,patients,lv,urine"|"aldosterone,diastolic,lv,patients,function" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the antihypertensive effect of valsartan (VAL) and  amlodipine (AML) treatments in elderly hypertensive patients by examining the  long-term changes in cognitive function and auditory P300 event-related  potentials. METHODS: We enrolled 20 outpatients, including 12 men and 8 women in   the age group of 56 to 81 years who had mild to moderate essential hypertension.   The subjects were randomly allocated to receive either 80 mg VAL once a day (10  patients) or 5 mg AML once a day (10 patients). Neuropsychological assessment and  auditory P300 event-related potentials were obtained before initiation of VAL or   AML treatment and after 6 months of the treatment with VAL or AML.  Neuropsychological assessment was evaluated by conducting the Mini-Mental State  Examination, the verbal fluency, word-list memory, word-list recall test,  word-list recognition, and Trails B tests. RESULTS: Both the groups showed  significantly reduced-blood pressure after 6 months of treatment, and the  intergroup difference was not significant. The mean baseline Mini-Mental State  Examination scores of the VAL and AML groups were not significantly different.  Amlodipine treatment did not significantly affect any test score, but VAL  treatment significantly increased the word-list memory and word-list recall test   scores. Valsartan, and not AML, significantly reduced the mean P300 latency after  6 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that VAL exerts a positive effect on  cognitive functions, independent of its antihypertensive effect."|"val,aml,significantly,treatment,p300"|"val,aml,list,significantly,treatment" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness and safety of nebivolol  with sustained-release metoprolol in reducing blood pressure by 1 mm of Hg per  day in hypertensive patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective,  randomized, open label, observational analysis of cost-effectiveness, in a  questionnaire-based fashion to compare the cost of nebivolol (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10  mg) and sustained released metoprolol succinate (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg) in  hypertensive patients using either of the two drugs. A total of 60 newly detected  drug naive hypertensive patients were considered for the comparison, of which 30   patients were prescribed nebivolol and the other 30 were prescribed metoprolol  succinate as per the recommended dosage. Based on the data, statistical analysis   was carried out using GraphPad Prism 5 and MS Excel Spreadsheet 2007. RESULT: The  cost of reducing 1 mm of Hg blood pressure per day with nebivolol was 0.60, 0.70,  and 1.06 INR, whereas that of metoprolol succinate was 0.93, 1.18, and 1.25 INR  at their respective equivalent doses, hence significantly lower with the  nebivolol group as compared to the metoprolol group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This   pharmacoeconomic analysis shows that nebivolol is more cost-effective as compared  to metoprolol when the cost per reduction in blood pressure per day is  considered. This may affect the patients economically during their long-term use   of these molecules for the treatment of hypertension."|"cost,nebivolol,patients,metoprolol,analysis"|"cost,metoprolol,mg,nebivolol,patients" 
"AB  - Nonlinear methods have been applied to the analysis of biological signals.  Complexity analysis of glucose time series may be a useful tool for the study of   the initial phases of glucoregulatory dysfunction. This observational,  cross-sectional study was performed in patients with essential hypertension.  Glucose complexity was measured with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and  glucose variability was measured by the mean amplitudes of glycemic excursion  (MAGE). We included 91 patients with a mean age of 59 +/- 10 years. We found  significant correlations for the number of metabolic syndrome (MS)-defining  criteria with DFA (r = 0.233, P = .026) and MAGE (r = 0.396, P < .0001). DFA  differed significantly between patients who complied with MS and those who did  not (1.44 vs. 1.39, P = .018). The MAGE (f = 5.3, P = .006), diastolic blood  pressures (f = 4.1, P = .018), and homeostasis model assessment indices (f = 4.2,  P = .018) differed between the DFA tertiles. Multivariate analysis revealed that   the only independent determinants of the DFA values were MAGE (beta coefficient =  0.002, 95% confidence interval: 0.001-0.004, P = .001) and abdominal  circumference (beta coefficient = 0.002, 95% confidence interval: 0.000015-0.004,  P = .048). In our population, DFA was associated with MS and a number of MS  criteria. Complexity analysis seemed to be capable of detecting differences in  variables that are arguably related to the risk of the development of type 2  diabetes."|"dfa,analysis,mage,patients,ms"|"dfa,analysis,mage,ms,018" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are used as antihypertensive agents  and have a strong vasodilatory effect; however, the sympathetic activation  mediated by baroreflex might cause adverse effects. A recently developed CCB,  azelnidipine, decreases the heart rate (HR) while lowering blood pressure (BP),  possibly by inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity in animal models. In this  study, we evaluated whether azelnidipine inhibited sympathetic nerve activity,  compared to amlodipine, in primary hypertensive patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We   conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, and crossover study of 14  patients. We measured the patients' BP, HR and baroreflex sensitivity, and  directly recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), via microneurography,  after treatment with either CCB for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Although systolic and  diastolic BPs did not differ between the azelnidipine and amlodipine groups, the   HR in the azelnidipine group significantly decreased compared with that in the  amlodipine group. MSNA was significantly reduced in the azelnidipine compared  with the amlodipine group (47.7 +/- 14.9 vs. 61.5 +/- 10.7 bursts per 100 beats,   P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in terms of the  baroreflex control of HR, or MSNA, between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our data  show, first, that azelnidipine, compared with amlodipine, exerted a favorable  effect on sympathetic nerve activity, without affecting baroreflex sensitivity,  in hypertensive patients. These results indicate that azelnidipine might be  useful for treating hypertensive patients, in whom hypertension is complicated by  heart failure and ischemic heart disease."|"azelnidipine,sympathetic,baroreflex,patients,hr"|"azelnidipine,amlodipine,patients,sympathetic,activity" 
"AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNA) plays an important role in biological development and disease  occurrence and development, and acts as a "main switch" in biology. Among  patients of essential hypertension, around 1/3 would suffer left ventricular  hypertrophy (LVH). Hence, essential hypertension becomes an independent risk  factor for cardiovascular diseases. And miRNAs plays an important role in the  occurrence and development of LVH. This paper reviewed the role of miRNA in  regulating the stress signaling pathway, defined its impact on the occurrence of   LVH, and further emphasized the opportunities and challenges of miRNA as a  biomarker and therapeutic target."|"lvh,occurrence,mirna,role,hypertension"|"development,lvh,mirna,occurrence,role" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and  angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary  hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90  mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and  morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of  the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing  total mortality and cardiovascular events is important. OBJECTIVES: To compare  the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular  events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people   with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension   Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International  Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We  contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also  searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies. SELECTION   CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with  uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk  factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a  head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If  background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the  study, the protocol to do so must have been the same in both study arms. DATA  COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by  The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies with 11,007 participants  were included. Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality,  three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on  cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity.   In contrast, eight studies contributed data on WDAE. Included studies were of  good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between ACE  inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence  interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to  1.19), or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). Conversely, a   high level of evidence indicated a slightly lower incidence of WDAE for ARBs as  compared with ACE inhibitors (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; absolute risk  reduction (ARR) 1.8%, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome  (NNTB) 55 over 4.1 years), mainly attributable to a higher incidence of dry cough  with ACE inhibitors. The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular  outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were  initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data  available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total  mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular   events was judged to be low by the GRADE approach. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our  analyses found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or cardiovascular  outcomes for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors, while ARBs caused slightly  fewer WDAEs than ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy in  these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same  conclusion for ARBs directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled  trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an ARB for an ACE inhibitor,  while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in  consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of ARBs regarding mortality  and morbidity outcomes compared with ACE inhibitors. Additionally, our data  mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension,  and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the  generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive  participants in existing trials comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs needs to be  made available for this purpose."|"ace,arbs,hypertension,inhibitors,data"|"ace,inhibitors,mortality,arbs,cardiovascular" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have presented evidence suggesting that dairy  consumption has beneficial effects on blood pressure (BP) in healthy subjects;  however, only a few studies have examined this possibility in patients with  established essential hypertension using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  The objective of this study was to investigate how consuming dairy products  impacts mean daytime systolic and diastolic BP in men and women with mild to  moderate essential hypertension. METHODS: Eighty-nine men and women with systolic  BP >/= 135 mm Hg and </= 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP </= 110 mm Hg were enrolled  in this single-blind, randomized, cross-over, controlled study. Participants had   to incorporate three daily servings of dairy products or control products  equivalent in macronutrients and sodium during four-week treatment phases.  Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP and endothelial function were assessed at  screening and at the end of each dietary phase. RESULTS: The consumption of three  daily servings of dairy products led to a significant reduction in mean daytime  ambulatory systolic BP (-2 mm Hg; P = 0.05) in men compared with readings after  the control phase. In women, dairy consumption had no effect on ambulatory  systolic BP. Moreover, endothelial function was significantly improved by dairy  consumption in the whole cohort. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the  consumption of three daily servings of dairy products have beneficial effects on   daytime systolic ambulatory BP compared to a heart-healthy, dairy-free, diet in  men with mild to moderate essential hypertension. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial   is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01776216."|"dairy,bp,ambulatory,consumption,systolic"|"bp,dairy,ambulatory,consumption,products" 
"AB  - Gene polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the  pathophysiology of hypertension. We genotyped 4 polymorphisms of angiotensinogen   (AGT) gene A-20C (rs5050), A-6G (rs5051), C3889T (rs4762), and C4072T (rs699) by   polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 652  patients and 780 controls to examine the association of AGT and hypertension in a  Northern Han Chinese population. There were significant differences in the  distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies at C4072T between the patients  and the controls (both P < .01); patients with CC genotype had a higher risk of  hypertension (odds ratio = 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.1). The  distribution of genotypes at A-6G was significantly different between patients  and controls (P < .05). No other significant differences in genotypes or  frequencies were observed. No association was observed between the haplotypes of   AGT and hypertension. The AGT-6A and 4072C alleles are associated with  susceptibility to hypertension in this population."|"hypertension,patients,agt,controls,c4072t"|"hypertension,agt,patients,controls,genotypes" 
"AB  - AIMS: In patients with hypertension (HT), increased aortic stiffness is related  to higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent investigations have  shown that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a new potential cardiometabolic  risk factor. The aim of our study was to examine the relation between  echocardiographically measured EAT thickness and aortic stiffness in patients  with primary HT. METHODS: The study included 144 newly diagnosed and untreated  essential hypertensive outpatients. Transthoracic echocardiographic EAT thickness  and aortic stiffness measurements were performed for all study participants.  Afterwards patients were divided in two groups according to their median EAT  thickness values. The patients with EAT thickness of < 7 mm were included in  group 1 and patients with EAT thickness of >/= 7 mm were included in group 2.  RESULTS: Aortic strain and distensibility parameters of group 2 were lower than  in group 1. The aortic stiffness index of group 2 was found to be higher than  group 1. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that EAT thickness was the  only independent variable for all three parameters of aortic stiffness index,  aortic strain and aortic distensibility. CONCLUSION: In patients with newly  diagnosed primary HT, increased EAT thickness was significantly linked to  impaired aortic elastic properties independently of other conventional adiposity   measurements."|"eat,aortic,thickness,stiffness,patients"|"aortic,eat,thickness,group,patients" 
"AB  - Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic plasticity has a critical role in  the pathophysiology of arterial remodeling in essential hypertension. MicroRNAs  are emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cardiovascular  disease. We assessed the expression levels of the microRNAs miR-143, miR-145,  miR-21, miR-133 and miR-1, which are implicated in VSMC phenotypic modulation, in  60 patients with essential hypertension and 29 healthy individuals. All patients   underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. MicroRNA levels in  peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantified by real-time reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction. Hypertensive patients showed lower  miR-143 (2.20+/-0.25 versus 4.19+/-0.57, P<0.001), miR-145 (13.51+/-1.73 versus  22.38+/-3.31, P=0.010) and miR-133 (8.15+/-1.32 versus 37.03+/-8.18, P<0.001) and  higher miR-21 (3.08+/-0.32 versus 2.06+/-0.31, P=0.048) and miR-1 (33.94+/-5.19  versus 12.35+/-2.13 P=0.006) expression levels compared with controls. In  hypertensive patients, we observed correlations of miR-143 (r = -0.380, P=0.003),  miR-145 (r=-0.405, P=0.001), miR-21 (r=-0.486, P<0.001) and miR-133 (r=0.479,  P<0.001) expression levels with 24-h diastolic BP. Furthermore, we observed  correlations of miR-21 (r=-0.291, P=0.024), miR-1 (r=-0.312, P=0.015) and miR-133  (r=0.310, P=0.016) levels with the dipping status. Associations of miR-143  (r=-0.292, P=0.025), miR-145 (r=-0.399, P=0.002), miR-21 (r=-0.343, P=0.008) and   miR-133 (r=0.370, P=0.004) levels with 24-h mean pulse pressure were also found.   Our data provide important evidence that VSMC-modulating microRNAs are closely  related to essential hypertension in humans and they may represent potential  therapeutic targets in essential hypertension."|"levels,mir,patients,vsmc,essential"|"mir,levels,001,133,21" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a very common clinical disorder affecting the  patient's health. Accumulating evidence indicates that immunological factors play  an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In the present paper, the   authors introduce 1) progress of researches on the pathogenesis of hypertension  from cellular immune and body fluid immune (multiple immuno-humoral factors); 2)   effects of acupuncture intervention on natural killer cell activity,  exercise-induced immunosuppression, circulating inflammatory factor levels and  balance of cytokines; 3) blood-pressure reduction effect of acupuncture  intervention by lowering circulating TNF-alpha, IL-6, matrix  metalloproteinases-9, angiotensin convertase and endothelin levels, and  up-regulating serum opioid peptide content, etc. to decrease inflammatory injury   of the cardiovascular system. Many researches have demonstrated that acupuncture   may have a positive role in improving EH in clinical practice, which may be  associated with its regulative effect on immune system, but its mechanism has not  been fully elucidated."|"immune,acupuncture,hypertension,circulating,effect"|"acupuncture,hypertension,immune,circulating,clinical" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val   108/158 Met polymorphism with essential hypertension in Chinese population.  METHODS: COMT Val 108/158 Met polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain  reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in a case-control  study, including 215 hypertensive patients (hypertensive group, n=215) and 227  controls (control group, n=227). RESULTS: 1)There was no significant difference  in the frequency distribution of genotypic (Val/Val, Val/Met, and Met/Met) and  the allelic of COMT gene Val 108/158 Met polymorphism between the 2 groups  (P>0.05). 2) After gender stratification, there was no significant difference in   the genotypic and allelic frequency distribution in men or women between the 2  groups (P>0.05). 3) After risk stratification of hypertension, there was no  significant difference in the genotypic and allelic frequency distribution  between the low risk, middle risk, high risk and very high risk grades (P>0.05).   4) Raised body mass index, blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein, and  hypertension family history were risk factors for hypertension by logistic  regression analysis, while genotype had no effect on the occurrence of  hypertension. CONCLUSION: No relationship between COMT Val 108/158 Met  polymorphism and essential hypertension has been found."|"hypertension,risk,polymorphism,val,met"|"met,val,hypertension,risk,polymorphism" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag   SNPs) of chymase gene (CMA1) with essential hypertension in Yi population from  Yunnan, China. METHODS: A case-control study was carried out. Four tag  SNPs(rs1956921, rs1800876, rs5244 and rs1885108) were genotyped in 303 patients  with essential hypertension and 312 healthy controls using polymerase chain  reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: No  significant difference in genotypic and allelic distributions of the four  polymorphisms was detected between the two groups(P>0.05), and the same results  existed in the females. The frequencies of rs1956921 C allele and a C-T haplotype  constructed with rs1956921 and rs5244 were greater in male patients compared with  male controls(P<0.01).

"AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to better understand the educational needs regarding  appropriate recognition, diagnosis and management of pediatric hypertension  (HTN), we asked practicing pediatricians questions regarding their educational  needs and comfort level on this topic. METHODS: We conducted 4 focus group  sessions that included 27 participants representing pediatric residents,  adolescent medicine physicians, clinic based pediatricians and office based  pediatricians. Each focus group session lasted for approximately an hour and 90  pages of total transcriptions were produced verbatim from audio recordings.  RESULTS: Four reviewers read each transcript and themes were elucidated from  these transcripts. Overall, 5 major themes related to educational needs and  clinical concerns were found: utilization of resources to define blood pressure  (BP), correct BP measurement method(s), co-morbidities, barriers to care, and  experience level with HTN. Six minor themes were also identified: differences in   BP measurement, accuracy of BP, recognition of HTN, practice pattern of care,  education of families and patients, and differences in level of training. The  focus group participants were also questioned on their preferences regarding  educational methods (i.e. e-learning, small group sessions, self-study, large  group presentations) and revealed varied teaching and learning preferences.  CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple methods to approach education regarding pediatric  HTN for primary care pediatricians based on provider preferences and multiple  educational activities should be pursued to achieve best outcomes. Based on this   data, the next direction will be to develop and deliver multiple educational  methods and to evaluate the impact on practice patterns of care for children and   adolescents with HTN."|"educational,group,htn,regarding,care"|"educational,group,htn,based,bp" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thiazide diuretics are one of the first choice antihypertensives but   not optimally utilised because of concerns regarding their adverse effects on  glucose metabolism. The Diuretics In the Management of Essential hypertension  (DIME) study was designed, for the first time, to assess the risk for type 2  diabetes mellitus in patients with essential hypertension during antihypertensive  treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics compared to those not treated with  diuretics. DESIGN: Multicentre, unblinded, pragmatic, randomised, controlled  trial with blinded assessment of end points and intention-to-treat analysis that   was started in 2004 and finished in 2012. SETTING: Hypertension clinics at 106  sites in Japan, including general practitioners' offices and teaching hospitals.   PARTICIPANTS: Non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension. INTERVENTIONS:  Antihypertensive treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics at 12.5 mg/day of  hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent (Diuretics group) or that without thiazide  diuretics (No-diuretics group). MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome was new onset  of type 2 diabetes diagnosed according to WHO criteria and the criteria of  Japanese Society of Diabetes. RESULTS: 1130 patients were allocated to Diuretics   (n=544) or No-diuretics group (n=586). Complete end point information was  collected for 1049 participants after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Diabetes  developed in 25 (4.6%) participants in the Diuretics group, as compared with 29  (4.9%) in the No-diuretics group (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.58; p=0.800).  CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive treatment with thiazide diuretics at low doses may   not be associated with an increased risk for new onset of type 2 diabetes. This  result might suggest safety of use of low doses of thiazide diuretics.

"AB  - Initial studies found that female Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats exhibit greater  blood pressure (BP) salt sensitivity than female spontaneously hypertensive rats   (SHR). On the basis of the central role played by NO in sodium excretion and BP  control, we further tested the hypothesis that blunted increases in BP in female   SHR will be accompanied by greater increases in renal inner medullary nitric  oxide synthase (NOS) activity and expression in response to a high-salt (HS) diet  compared with DS rats. Gonad-intact and ovariectomized (OVX) female SHR and DS  rats were placed on normal salt (NS; 0.4% salt) or HS (4% salt) diet for 2 wk.  OVX did not alter BP in SHR, and HS diet produced a modest increase in BP. OVX  significantly increased BP in DS rats on NS; HS further increased BP in all DS  rats, although OVX had a greater increase in BP. Renal inner medullary NOS  activity, total NOS3 protein, and NOS3 phosphorylated on serine residue 1177 were  not altered by salt or OVX in either strain. NOS1 protein expression, however,  significantly increased with HS only in SHR, and this corresponded to an increase  in urinary nitrate/nitrite excretion. SHR also exhibit greater NOS1 and NOS3  protein expression than DS rats. These data indicate that female sex hormones  offer protection against HS-mediated elevations in BP in DS rats but not SHR. We   propose that the relative resistance to HS-mediated increases in BP in SHR is  related to greater NOS expression and the ability to increase NOS1 protein  expression compared with DS rats."|"shr,bp,rats,salt,female"|"bp,rats,ds,shr,hs" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of copy number variation (CNV) has been poorly explored in  essential hypertension in part due to technical difficulties in accurately  assessing absolute numbers of DNA copies. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) provides a   powerful new approach to CNV quantitation. The aim of our study was to  investigate whether CNVs located in regions previously associated with blood  pressure (BP) variation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were associated  with essential hypertension by the use of ddPCR. METHODS: Using a "power of  extreme" approach, we quantified nucleic acids using ddPCR in white subjects from  the Victorian Family Heart Study with extremely high (n = 96) and low (n = 92)  SBP, providing power equivalent to 1714 subjects selected at random. RESULTS: A  deletion of the CNVs esv27061 and esv2757747 on chromosome 1p13.2 was  significantly more prevalent in extreme high BP subjects after adjustment for  age, body mass index and sex (12.6% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Our data  suggests that CNVs within regions identified in previous GWAS may play a role in   human essential hypertension."|"subjects,cnvs,ddpcr,essential,hypertension"|"cnvs,ddpcr,essential,hypertension,subjects" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies have shown that E-selectin gene polymorphisms   (A561C and C1839T) may be associated with essential hypertension (EH), but the  results are conflicting in different ethnic populations. Thus, we performed this   meta-analysis to investigate a more authentic association between E-selectin gene  polymorphisms and the risk of EH. METHODS: We searched the relevant studies for  the present meta-analysis from the following electronic databases: PubMed,  Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, and China  National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence  interval (CI) were used to evaluate the strength of the association between  E-selectin gene polymorphisms and EH susceptibility. The pooled ORs were  performed for dominant model, allelic model and recessive model. The publication   bias was examined by Begg's funnel plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of  eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies came from Asians. Ten  studies (12 cohorts) evaluated the A561C polymorphism and EH risk, including  2,813 cases and 2,817 controls. The pooled OR was 2.280 (95%CI: 1.893-2.748,  P<0.001) in dominant model, 5.284 (95%CI: 2.679-10.420, P<0.001) in recessive  model and 2.359 (95%CI: 1.981-2.808, P = 0.001) in allelic model. Four studies  (six cohorts) evaluated C1839T polymorphism and EH risk, including 1,700 cases  and 1,681 controls. The pooled OR was 0.785 (95%CI: 0.627-0.983, P = 0.035) in  dominant model, 1.250 (95%CI: 0.336-4.652, P = 0.739) in recessive model and  0.805 (95%CI: 0.649-0.999, P = 0.049) in allelic model. CONCLUSION: The current  meta-analysis concludes that the C allele of E-selectin A561C gene polymorphism  might increase the EH risk in Asian population, whereas the T allele of  E-selectin C1839T gene polymorphism might decrease the EH risk."|"studies,eh,selectin,gene,meta"|"model,95,ci,eh,studies" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is one of the major cardiovascular diseases. It affects   nearly 1.56 billion people worldwide. The present study is about a particular  genetic polymorphism (A1166C), gene expression and protein expression of the  angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) (SNP ID: rs5186) and its association with  essential hypertension in a Northern Indian population. METHODS: We analyzed the   A1166C polymorphism and expression of AT1R gene in 250 patients with essential  hypertension and 250 normal healthy controls. RESULTS: A significant association   was found in the AT1R genotypes (AC+CC) with essential hypertension (chi2 =  22.48, p = 0.0001). Individuals with CC genotypes were at 2.4 times higher odds  (p = 0.0001) to develop essential hypertension than individuals with AC and AA  genotypes. The statistically significant intergenotypic variation in the systolic  blood pressure was found higher in the patients with CC (169.4+/-36.3 mmHg) as  compared to that of AA (143.5+/-28.1 mmHg) and AC (153.9+/-30.5 mmHg) genotypes  (p = 0.0001). We found a significant difference in the average delta-CT value (p   = 0.0001) wherein an upregulated gene expression (approximately 16 fold) was  observed in case of patients as compared to controls. Furthermore, higher  expression of AT1R gene was observed in patients with CC genotype than with AC  and AA genotypes. A significant difference (p = 0.0001) in the protein expression  of angiotensin II Type 1 receptor was also observed in the plasma of patients  (1.49+/-0.27) as compared to controls (0.80+/-0.24). CONCLUSION: Our findings  suggest that C allele of A1166C polymorphism in the angiotensin II type 1  receptor gene is associated with essential hypertension and its upregulation  could play an important role in essential hypertension."|"hypertension,essential,gene,expression,patients"|"hypertension,essential,expression,0001,gene" 
"AB  - A 33-year-old woman with presumed essential hypertension and symptoms equivalent   to New York Heart Association class II was suspected of heart failure and  referred to echocardiography. The patient's ECG showed a left bundle branch  block. Electrolytes, serum creatinine and estimated-glomerular filtration rate as  well as urine test for protein were all normal. The patient had no peripheral  oedema. The transthoracic echocardiography confirmed systolic and diastolic  dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 25% and left ventricular hypertrophy.  Ultrasound of renal arteries and renal CT angiography (renal CTA) revealed a  significant stenosis and an aneurysm corresponding to the right renal artery with  challenges to traditional interventions."|"renal,echocardiography,patient,left,heart"|"renal,echocardiography,heart,left,patient" 
"AB  - CONTEXT: Hypertension treatments include sodium restriction, pharmacological  management, and lifestyle modifications. Although many cases of hypertension can   be controlled by medication, individuals may experience side effects or incur  out-of-pocket expenses, and some may not comply with the treatment regimen.  Although some previous studies have shown a favorable effect for qigong on  hypertension, well-designed, rigorous trials evaluating the effect of qigong on  hypertension are scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of  qigong on prehypertension and mild hypertension and to calculate a sample size  for a subsequent randomized, clinical trial (RCT). DESIGN: Participants were  randomized to a qigong group or an untreated control group. SETTING: This study  was conducted at the Oriental Medical Center of Dongeui University, in the  Republic of Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were individuals between the ages  of 19 and 65 y with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 120 and 159 mm Hg  and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 and 99 mm Hg. INTERVENTION: The   qigong group attended qigong classes 3 x/wk and performed qigong at home at least  2 x/wk. Participants in the control group did not receive any intervention for  hypertension. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures for this study were (1) changes   in blood pressure (BP); (2) quality of life (QOL) using 2 surveys: the Medical  Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item short form (SF-36) (Korean version) and the Measure   Yourself Medical Outcome Profile 2 (MYMOP2); and (3) hormone levels. RESULTS: Of   40 participants, 19 were randomly assigned to the qigong group, and 21 were  assigned to the control group. After 8 wk, significant differences were observed   between the qigong and the control groups regarding changes in SBP (P = .0064)  and DBP (P = .0003). Among the categories of the MYMOP2 questionnaire, only  wellbeing was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .0322). The  qigong group showed a significantly greater improvement in the physical component  score of the SF-36 compared with the control group (P = .0373). Regarding changes  in hormone levels, there was no significant difference between the qigong and the  control groups. This pilot study demonstrates that regarding sample size, a RCT  evaluating the effect of qigong on hypertension should include 22 participants  based on DBP and 285 participants based on SBP in each group, thus allowing for a  loss to follow-up rate of 20%. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that qigong may  be an effective intervention in reducing BP in prehypertension and mild  hypertension. Further studies should include an appropriate sample size and  methodology to determine the mechanism of qigong on BP."|"qigong,hypertension,group,study,participants"|"qigong,group,hypertension,participants,control" 
"AB  - Hypertension is becoming a public health emergency worldwide. It has been seen  that both genetics and gene-environment interactions are major determinants of  lipoprotein abnormalities and hypertension. This study elucidates the effect of  apolipoprotein AI gene polymorphism (G-75A and C+83T) in 50 cases of essential  hypertension and equal number of age & sex matched control subjects in the Indian  population. Higher instances of obesity and more adverse biochemical profiles  were found in hypertensives [GA (74%) and CT (56%) most commonly observed  genotypes]. Presence of A and T alleles and GA (-75 bp) and CT (+83 bp)  heterozygosity in apolipoprotein AI gene play an important role in essential  hypertension (GA genotype had an odds ratio of 4.27 (1.69-10.96) of developing  essential hypertension). The odds ratio for the GA genotype was 3.74 (95%CI,  0.83-9.0) in the presence of confounding factors including total proteins,  albumin, amylase, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL and body mass index. It  indicates one of the potential areas where population studies may be taken up for  identifying the genetic basis of essential hypertension."|"hypertension,ga,essential,gene,population"|"hypertension,essential,ga,gene,74" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with  hypertension. We planned to research the effect of vitamin D and nifedipine in  the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: Patients with  grades I-II essential hypertension were enrolled in this single-center,  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Beijing. All patients received a  conventional antihypertensive drug (nifedipine, 30 mg/d). One hundred and  twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D (n=63, 2000 IU/d)  or a placebo (n=63) as an add-on to nifedipine, by the method of permutated block  randomization. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline  (month 0), at month 3 and at month 6. RESULTS: In vitamin D supplementation  group, there was a significant increase in mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from  baseline (19.4 +/- 11.6 ng/ml) to 6 months (34.1 +/- 12.2 ng/ml; p<0.001). At 6  months, the primary end points, a difference in the fall of 24-h mean blood  pressure, between the groups was -6.2 mmHg (95% CI -11.2; -1.1) for systolic  blood pressure (p<0.001) and -4.2 mmHg (95% CI -8.8; -0.3) for diastolic blood  pressure (p<0.001) under intention to treat analysis. In patients with vitamin D   <30 ng/ml at baseline (n=113), 24-h mean blood pressure decreased by 7.1/5.7 mmHg  (p<0.001). Safety and tolerability were similar among the two groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation can reduce blood pressure in patients with  hypertension, it can be an adjuvant therapy for patients with grades I-II  essential hypertension.

These  levels were assessed with realtime PCR method at daily hours 9, 13, and 17. The  significant differences were revealed in transcript levels of the examined genes   in patients with various genotypes at the polymorphic markers 3111TC and 257TG  regulatory regions of CLOCK gene.

"AB  - The aim of the study was to improve the diagnosis of essential hypertension (EH)   stage II in patients with different circadian blood pressure profile through a  comprehensive analysis of various parts of hemodynamics. The diagnostic  capabilities of compression-decompression test by using of original method  angio-tensio-rheo-baro-graphy (ATRBG), which is based on volume-impedance  dependence of forearm tissue's hyperemia, peculiarities of the changes of  microcirculation of the nail bed and central venous pressure (CVP) have been  studied in 92 patients with EH stage II depending on the circadian rhythm of  blood pressure. The results of using ATRBG may indicate that the arterial  hypertension is combined with venous one in the majority of patients with EH  stage II. We have discovered the inverse relationship between the increasing of  CVP level and the decreasing of density of functional capillaries in the patients  with low (non-dipper) and negative (night-picker) circadian index of arterial  pressure that can be proposed as new diagnostic criteria of progression of EH."|"pressure,patients,eh,circadian,hypertension"|"eh,patients,pressure,circadian,ii" 
"AB  - The (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) is expressed in several tissues including kidney,  heart and brain, and is thought to regulate the tissue renin-angiotensin system  (RAS) through the non-proteolytic activation of prorenin. (P)RR is cleaved by  furin to generate soluble (P)RR (s(P)RR), which is secreted into the  extracellular space. s(P)RR is a candidate biomarker reflecting the status of the  tissue RAS. Here, we investigated the relationship between background factors and  serum s(P)RR levels. We measured s(P)RR levels in 122 patients with essential  hypertension (EH) and assessed the relationships between background factors and  s(P)RR levels. Serum s(P)RR levels were 19.0+/-4.9 ng ml(-1). Single regression  analyses showed that age (r=0.251, P<0.01), serum creatinine levels (r=0.229,  P<0.05) and urinary angiotensinogen excretion (r=0.196, P<0.05) were positively  correlated with s(P)RR levels, whereas estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR; r=-0.337, P<0.001) were negatively correlated. Multiple regression  analyses of age, blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and s(P)RR levels  revealed that age and s(P)RR levels were negatively correlated with the eGFR  (P<0.05). In patients with EH, serum s(P)RR levels correlated positively with  renal function independent of age, BP and HbA1c. These findings support s(P)RR as  a useful biomarker that reflects the status of the tissue RAS."|"rr,levels,age,correlated,tissue"|"rr,levels,age,correlated,serum" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The T594M variant of the beta-subunit of the sodium epithelial  channel (ENaC) gene may contribute to hypertension in individuals of Indo-Aryan  origin. METHODS: Present study was performed to assess the role of the ENaC gene   variant as an independent risk factor for hypertension in subjects of Indo-Aryan   ancestry. A total of 150 patients of recently detected essential hypertension and  150 matched controls were genotyped for the T594M polymorphism of the ENaC gene  by PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: beta-T594M mutation was found to be non-polymorphic.  There was major genotype call in both the groups i.e. cases and controls. Other  phenotypic parameters like age, sex and body mass index were also similar among  hypertensive patients and controls (P > 0.05). Hypertensive patients had  significantly higher total cholesterol and triglycerides compared with controls  (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results do not suggest an important role for the   T594M variant of the ENaC gene contributing to either the development or severity  of hypertension in subjects of Indo-Aryan ancestry."|"controls,enac,hypertension,gene,t594m"|"controls,enac,gene,hypertension,t594m" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the use of antihypertensive medications and diagnostic tests   among adolescents and young adults with primary versus secondary hypertension.  METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort analysis of claims data for  adolescents and young adults (12-21 years of age) with >/=3 years of insurance  coverage (>/=11 months/year) in a large private managed care plan during  2003-2009 with diagnosis of primary hypertension or secondary hypertension. We  examined their use of antihypertensive medications and identified demographic  characteristics and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. For the subset  receiving antihypertensive medications, we examined their diagnostic test use  (echocardiograms, renal ultrasounds, and electrocardiograms). RESULTS: The study   sample included 1,232 adolescents and young adults; 84% had primary hypertension   and 16% had secondary hypertension. The overall prevalence rate of hypertension  was 2.6%. One quarter (28%) with primary hypertension had one or more  antihypertensive medications, whereas 65% with secondary hypertension had one or   more antihypertensive medications. Leading prescribers of antihypertensives for  subjects with primary hypertension were primary care physicians (80%), whereas  antihypertensive medications were equally prescribed by primary care physicians  (43%) and sub-specialists (37%) for subjects with secondary hypertension.  CONCLUSIONS: The predominant hypertension diagnosis among adolescents and young  adults is primary hypertension. Antihypertensive medication use was higher among   those with secondary hypertension compared with those with primary hypertension.   Further study is needed to determine treatment effectiveness and patient outcomes  associated with differential treatment patterns used for adolescents and young  adults with primary versus secondary hypertension."|"hypertension,antihypertensive,primary,medications,secondary"|"hypertension,primary,antihypertensive,secondary,medications" 
"AB  - This study investigates arterial stiffness changes after acute exercise in young   patients with untreated, recently diagnosed grade I essential hypertension (UH)  compared with normotensive (NT) individuals and the effect of antihypertensive  treatment on this phenomenon. Study 1 consisted of 25 UH and 15 NT patients. UH  patients who received treatment were included in study 2 and were followed-up  after a 3-month treatment period with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. Aortic   pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed at baseline, at maximal exercise, and at  10, 30, and 60 minutes later. In UH patients, PWV increased significantly at  maximal exercise and 10 and 30 minutes of recovery, despite blood pressure fall  to baseline levels. No significant PWV changes were observed in NT patients.  Post-treatment PWV levels were significantly decreased and similar to those of NT  patients. Arterial stiffness is impaired following high-intensity acute exercise   even in the early stages of hypertension. Antihypertensive treatment ameliorates   these effects."|"patients,treatment,exercise,pwv,nt"|"patients,treatment,exercise,nt,pwv" 
"AB  - Bradykinin participates in various hypertensive processes, exerted via its type 1  and type 2 receptors (BKR1 and BKR2). The aim of the study was to investigate  BKR1 and BK2R gene expression in peripheral monocytes in patients with essential   hypertension compared with healthy individuals. Seventeen hypertensive patients  (9 males, age 56 +/- 7 years) and 12 healthy individuals (7 males, age 55 +/- 6)   participated. Mononuclear cells isolated using anti-CD14+ antibodies and mRNAs of  BKR1 and BKR2 were estimated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.  Both BKR1 and BKR2 showed significantly upregulated gene expression in the group   of hypertensive patients. Specifically, BKR1 gene expression was 142.1 +/- 42.2  in hypertensives versus 20.2 +/- 8 in controls (P = 0.024) and BKR2 was 1222.2  +/- 361.6 in hypertensives versus 259.5 +/- 99.1 in controls (P = 0.038).  Antihypertensive treatment resulted in a decrease in BKR1 (from 142.1 +/- 42.2 to  55.2 +/- 17.1, P = 0.065) and in BKR2 (from 1222.2 +/- 361.6 to 256.8 +/- 81.8, P  = 0.014) gene expression. BKR1 and BKR2 gene expression on peripheral monocytes  is upregulated in essential hypertension. This may lead to functional changes in   monocytes and contribute to the development of target organ damage in  hypertensive patients."|"bkr1,bkr2,hypertensive,patients,monocytes"|"bkr1,bkr2,expression,gene,hypertensive" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension and an atherogenic lipid profile are known risk factors  for coronary heart disease (CHD). Hypertensives show greater changes in  atherogenic plasma lipids to acute stress than normotensives. In this study, we  investigated whether attribution of failure is associated with lipid stress  reactivity in hypertensive compared with normotensive men. METHODS: 18  normotensive and 17 hypertensive men (mean+/-SEM; 45+/-2.2 years) underwent an  acute standardized psychosocial stress task that can be viewed as a situation of   experimentally induced failure. We assessed external-stable (ES),  external-variable (EV), internal-stable (IS), and internal-variable (IV)  attribution of failure and psychological control variables (i.e. extent of  depression and neuroticism). Moreover, total cholesterol (TC),  low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and norepinephrine were measured  immediately before and several times after stress. RESULTS: ES moderated TC- and   LDL-C-stress reactivity in hypertensives as compared to normotensives  (interaction mean arterial pressure [MAP]-by-ES for TC: F=3.71, p=.015; for  LDL-C: F=3.61, p=.016). TC and LDL-C levels were highest in hypertensives with  low ES immediately after stress (p</=.039). In contrast, hypertensives with high   ES did not differ from normotensives in TC and LDL-C immediately after stress  (p's>.28). Controlling for norepinephrine, depression, and neuroticism in  addition to age and BMI did not significantly change results. There were no  significant associations between lipid baseline levels or aggregated lipid  secretion and IS, IV, or EV (p's>.23). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ES may  independently protect from elevated lipid stress reactivity in hypertensive  individuals. ES thus might be a protective factor against CHD in hypertension."|"stress,es,lipid,hypertensives,tc"|"stress,es,ldl,lipid,tc" 
"AB  - Low grade inflammation exerts a crucial pathogenic role in hypertension and  cardiovascular disease. A large body of evidence indicates that innate and  adaptive immune systems, and in particular T cells, are involved. A balance  between T-effector lymphocytes and Treg lymphocytes represents a crucial  regulatory mechanism that, when altered, favours blood pressure elevation and  organ damage development. Of note, Treg lymphocytes exert important  anti-inflammatory properties, whose activities guarantees vascular homeostasis  and protects the vessel wall from the development of atherosclerosis. In humans,   most of evidence ascertaining essential hypertension as a condition of chronic  low-grade inflammatory status revealed a strict and independent association  between CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6 or adhesion molecules and vascular changes in  essential hypertensive patients. Evidence of involvement of the immune system in   vasculature from patients with hypertension or cardiovascular disease starts to  appear in literature. Further investigation on immunity, including the role of  T-lymphocytes, will help develop of new therapeutic targets that may improve  outcomes in hypertension and cardiovascular disease and discover novel approaches  in the treatment of hypertension and vascular disease."|"hypertension,lymphocytes,vascular,evidence,cardiovascular"|"hypertension,disease,lymphocytes,cardiovascular,evidence" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore safe, effective, simple and easy non-drug treatments for  grade 1 essential hypertension. METHODS: According to TCM syndrome  differentiation, 126 cases of grade 1 essential hypertension were classified into  4 types: liver-fire hyperactivity syndrome, yin-deficiency and yang-hyperactivity  syndrome, excessive phlegm-dampness syndrome, yin-yang deficiency syndrome, and  then the patients were randomly divided into a photoelectric combined with  musical treatment group (group A), an acupuncture group(group B) and a placebo  group (group C). The acupoints were selected according to TCM syndrome  differentiation in group A and group B, and multi-mode audio frequency pulse  photoelectric therapeutic apparatus and acupuncture were used in the two groups  respectively, once daily. Taichong (LR 3) and Quchi (LI 11) were selected in  liver-fire hyperactivity syndrome, Taixi (KI 3) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6) were  selected yi yin-deficiency and yang-hyperactivity syndrome, Zusanli (ST 36) and  Fenglong (ST 40) were selected in excessive phlegm-dampness syndrome, while Taixi  (KI 3) and Guanyuan (CV 4) were selected yi yirryang deficiency syndrome. The  group C was treated with oral administration of starch tablet (25 mg), one tablet  each time,three times everyday. Ten days were considered as one course, totally  three courses were required in the three groups.

"AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Blood pressure control is closely related to target organ  damage in elderly patients with hypertension. The aim of this study was to  determine the relationship between ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)  indices and cardiac damage in elderly male patients with treated essential  hypertension (EH). METHOD: This study included 998 Chinese men (mean age, 78.44  +/- 12.02 years) with EH. Participants underwent cardiac function assessment,  laboratory testing, and ABPM, including ABP, BP variability, BP circadian  rhythms, and hypertensive or hypotensive time indices. The relationships between   ABPM indices and cardiac damage (expressed by shape and function) were assessed  using ridge regression analysis. RESULTS: Ridge regression analysis revealed the   following after adjustments for age, common cardiovascular risk factors, disease,  and medications: N-terminal fragment pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was  negatively correlated with the diastolic blood pressure nocturnal fall rate; the   peak early/atrial velocity (E/A) ratio E/A ratio was negatively correlated with  the 24 h mean systolic blood pressure (24 hmSBP), daytime SBP (dSBP), and  nocturnal SBP (nSBP); and ejection fraction (EF) was negatively correlated with  24 h SBP percent time of elevation (24 hSBP PTE %) and 24 h DBP percent time of  elevation (24 hDBP PTE %). Left ventricular mass (LVM) was positively correlated   with the 24 hmSBP, dSBP, nSBP, 24 h mean pulse pressure (24 hmPP), day mean pulse  pressure, and nocturnal mean arterial pressure, whereas LVM was negatively  correlated with the NDBPF. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the ABPM indices  associated with cardiac damage may be regarded as an early predictive marker for   cardiac function impairment in elderly male patients with EH."|"pressure,correlated,cardiac,negatively,blood"|"24,pressure,cardiac,correlated,mean" 
"AB  - AIM: We report the first experience of Lyon's university hospital regarding renal  denervation to treat patients with resistant essential hypertension. PATIENTS AND  METHODS: Over a one-year period, 17 patients were treated (12 men, 5 women) with   renal denervation. Baseline characteristics were as follows: age 56.5+/-11.5  years, BMI 33+/-5kg/m(2) and ambulatory blood pressure 157+/-16/87+/-13mmHg with   4.2+/-1.5 anti-hypertensive treatment. RESULTS: We did not observe  intra-operative or early complications. After a median follow-up of 3 months and   with the same anti-hypertensive treatment, office systolic blood pressure (SBP)  and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease respectively of 20+/-15 (P<0.001) and  10+/-13mmHg (P=0.014) (n=17). After six months of follow-up, ambulatory blood  pressure (ABPM) decrease of 17.5+/-14.9mmHg (P=0.027) for SBP and of  10.5+/-9.6mmHg (P=0.029) for DBP (n=6). Among these patients, five of them were  controlled (ABPM inferior to 130/80mmHg) and electrical left ventricular  hypertrophy indexes decreased: R wave in aVL lead of 4+/-3mm (P=0.031), Sokolow  index of 3+/-3mm (P=0.205), Cornell voltage criterion of 9+/-7mm (P=0.027) and  Cornell product of 1310+/-1104 (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: Our results are in  accordance with data from other centers. On average blood pressure decreases  significantly but important inter individual variations are observed. The  procedure seems safe."|"patients,blood,pressure,mmhg,mm"|"blood,pressure,patients,027,17" 
"AB  - Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and abnormal  adipokine levels are biological alterations that affect blood pressure regulation  and interact to link hypertension, obesity and metabolic diseases. While  imbalanced levels of hormones produced by adipocytes including  hypo-adiponectinaemia and hyperleptinaemia were reported in hypertension, little   is known about how antihypertensive therapy affects these alterations. This study  aimed to evaluate the effects of enalapril on plasma adiponectin and leptin  levels in hypertensive individuals. Thirty-seven untreated hypertensive patients   were prospectively treated with enalapril for 8 weeks. Blood samples were  collected at baseline and after the treatment with enalapril. Plasma adiponectin   and leptin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. We found  significant increases in adiponectin levels after enalapril treatment (5.4 +/-  3.7 versus 6.0 +/- 4.5 mug/mL, mean +/- S.D., p = 0.04). Conversely, leptin  levels were unchanged (18.0 +/- 14.7 versus 18.4 +/- 14.8 ng/mL, mean +/- S.D., p  = 0.31). Multiple linear regression revealed that baseline leptin is a  significant predictor of systolic blood pressure reduction (beta=0.269, p = 0.01)  in hypertensive individuals treated with enalapril. While enalapril increases  adiponectin levels in hypertensive individuals, baseline leptin levels predict  blood pressure reduction in response to this therapy. These findings support the   idea of an important relationship between RAAS and adipose tissue in hypertension  and suggest that enalapril improves the adipokine profile, possibly allowing  beneficial effects to overweight or obese hypertensive individuals."|"levels,enalapril,hypertension,blood,leptin"|"levels,enalapril,hypertensive,leptin,adiponectin" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: The main objective was to compare the mean change in augmentation  index of hypertensive patients treated with nebivolol or atenolol. METHODS:  Multicenter, double-blind randomized study conducted in six Spanish centers. We  enrolled outpatients between the ages of 40 and 65 years with mild or moderate  essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure, SBP >/= 140 mmHg to </= 179 mmHg  and diastolic blood pressure, DBP >/= 90 mmHg to </= 109 mmHg after a 2-week  run-in placebo period). Patients received nebivolol 5 mg or atenolol 50 mg once  daily. At week 3, atenolol could be titrated up to 100 mg qd for non-responders.   Additionally, patients not achieving normal blood pressure after 6 weeks could be  treated with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. Follow-up visits were at 3, 6 and 10  weeks. RESULTS: The final study population of 138 patients (58% men; median age  52.6 years, range 40-67 years) was randomized into two groups of 69 patients  each. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. At the screening  visit, 69% presented with mild hypertension. Nebivolol modified the mean  augmentation index to a lesser extent than atenolol after 10 weeks (mean  difference 3.1%, 95% CI 0.55-5.69; p = 0.027). A higher proportion of patients in  the atenolol group required a diuretic. Reductions in central aortic pressure and  peripheral arterial pressure were similar for both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS:  The study confirms that nebivolol produces a less pronounced impact on  augmentation index than atenolol."|"patients,atenolol,pressure,nebivolol,study"|"atenolol,patients,pressure,mg,mmhg" 
"AB  - Morning blood pressure (BP) surge is reported as a risk factor for cardiovascular  events and end-organ damage independent of the 24-h BP level. Controlling morning  BP surge is therefore important to help prevent onset of cardiovascular disease.   We compared the efficacy of azilsartan and candesartan in controlling morning  systolic BP (SBP) surges by analyzing relevant ambulatory BP monitoring data in  patients with/without baseline BP surges. As part of a 16-week randomized,  double-blind study of azilsartan (20-40 mg once daily) and candesartan (8-12 mg  once daily) in Japanese patients with essential hypertension, an exploratory  analysis was carried out using ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline and week 14.   The effects of study drugs on morning BP surges, including sleep trough surge  (early morning SBP minus the lowest night-time SBP) and prewaking surge (early  morning SBP minus SBP before awakening), were evaluated. Patients with sleep  trough surge of at least 35 mmHg were defined by the presence of a morning BP  surge (the 'surge group'). Sleep trough surge and prewaking surge data were  available at both baseline and week 14 in 548 patients, 147 of whom (azilsartan  76; candesartan 71) had a baseline morning BP surge. In surge group patients,  azilsartan significantly reduced both the sleep trough surge and the prewaking  surge at week 14 compared with candesartan (least squares means of the  between-group differences -5.8 mmHg, P=0.0395; and -5.7 mmHg, P=0.0228,  respectively). Once-daily azilsartan improved sleep trough surge and prewaking  surge to a greater extent than candesartan in Japanese patients with grade I-II  essential hypertension."|"bp,surge,morning,patients,azilsartan"|"surge,bp,morning,patients,azilsartan" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent findings from randomized clinical trials  indicate an improved patient adherence and blood pressure (BP) control by using  fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) in the treatment of hypertension. The aim of the  present study was to verify those data in a large real-world sample of  hypertensive patients and to cross-check adherence evaluation performed by  physicians and patients self-assessment. METHODS: A European multi-center,  prospective, 24-week, non-interventional study was conducted including 14,979  patients with essential hypertension and new treatment with olmesartan,  amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide as an FDC. Patients' adherence was measured  using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and a non-standardized  questionnaire was used by physicians and patients for self-assessment. RESULTS:  The mean age of the patients was 63.9+/-11.78 years and 46.5% were women. One or   more cardiovascular risk factors were present in 71.9% of patients and 94.7% had   been treated for hypertension before study entry. Mean adherence to medication by  MMAS-8 improved from 6.0 to 6.9 at study end. Corresponding improvements of  adherence were seen on physicians' and patients' self-assessments throughout the   study. Mean decrease of systolic/diastolic BP was 26.4/12.8 mmHg without a  relevant difference between the MMAS-8 adherence levels. BP target achievement  improved from 55.3 to 67.7% in patients with low versus high adherence. The  overall rate of patients with adverse drug reactions was very low (1.76%) but  more frequent in patients with low adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm  previous clinical trial data on the improvement of medication adherence by  switching antihypertensive combination therapy to an FDC and a subsequent  improvement in BP target achievement. An observed trend toward a reduction in  adverse drug reactions needs to be further investigated in clinical trials."|"patients,adherence,study,bp,clinical"|"patients,adherence,study,bp,clinical" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Chinese massage, named Tuina, is commonly used in China and  potentially effective for essential hypertension (EH). However, there is no  critically appraised evidence such as systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the   effectiveness and safety of Tuina for EH. METHODS: The following electronic  databases: Pubmed, the Cochrane library, CNKI, the Wan Fang Database and VIP were  searched for published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of  Tuina for EH up to 20th August 2013. RESULTS: Seven randomized trials involving  479 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed superior effects   of Tuina plus antihypertensive drugs compared to antihypertensive drugs alone,  however, Tuina alone was not superior to antihypertensive drugs. The safety of  Tuina for EH was still unclear because adverse effects were not assessed in most   of the original trials. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our review suggest that  Tuina might be a beneficial adjuvant for patients with EH, although the results  are of limited value due to the clinical heterogeneity and low methodological  quality of the included studies. Future studies should adhere to high-quality  RCTs with long follow-up for demonstrating the effectiveness of Tuina for  inpatients with EH."|"tuina,eh,trials,results,rcts"|"tuina,eh,antihypertensive,drugs,results" 
"AB  - Oxidative stress is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of essential  hypertension. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymes are key components of  cellular defense against oxidative stress. The present study aimed to clarify the  association between polymorphisms in GST and risk of essential hypertension using  a meta-analysis of published studies. PubMed-Medline, Ovid-EMBASE, HuGE Navigator  and SCOPUS databases were searched to identify case-control studies that examined  the association of GST polymorphisms and hypertension. Data were extracted using   standardized methods. Combined odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals  (CI) for the association of polymorphisms with hypertension were calculated using  a fixed effect approach and under dominant, recessive, additive and overdominant   models of inheritance. A total of 12 studies comprising 2,040 cases and 2,462  controls fulfilled the inclusion criteria. GSTM1 (presence/null), GSTT1  (presence/null) and GSTP1 (Ile105Val; rs1695) polymorphisms were evaluated.  Meta-analysis revealed significant associations between the null genotypes of  GSTM1 (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08-1.39; p=0.002) and GSTT1 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI:  1.13-1.50; p=0.0003) and risk of hypertension. The observed associations were  robust in sensitivity analyses. However, no significant association was found for  the rs1695 polymorphism under all assessed modes of inheritance. Findings of the   present meta-analysis demonstrated that GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes may serve   as predisposing factors for essential hypertension. Further studies are warranted  to validate this association, and also to explore if these null genotypes are in   linkage with other hypertension susceptibility polymorphisms."|"hypertension,association,studies,polymorphisms,null"|"hypertension,association,null,polymorphisms,studies" 
"AB  - AIMS: The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between morning  blood pressure surge (MBPS), hemodynamic parameters, glycemic control and 24-h  urinary sodium excretion (USE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MBPS and central hemodynamic parameters were assessed from  ambulatory blood pressure measurements. In addition to routine biochemistry, 24h   urine collection was performed to measure protein, albumin and sodium excretion.   RESULTS: There were 146 (38%) patients with T2DM and 238 (72%) patients without  T2DM (control group). Patients with T2DM had statistically higher MBPS compared  with patients without T2DM (P<0.0001). In patients with T2DM, MBPS was correlated  with HbA1c (rho=0.311, P<0.0001), 24h urinary sodium excretion (USE) (rho=0.292,   P=0.004) and various hemodynamic parameters. Additionally, regression analysis  showed that being male (P=0.006), the presence of coronary artery disease  (P=0.023), HbA1c (P=0.012), and 24h USE (P=0.001) were independently related with  log MBPS in T2DM patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that T2DM was an  independent risk factor for increased MBPS and MBPS was associated with central  hemodynamic parameters. Additionally poor glycemic control and sodium intake were  associated with worse MBPS in T2DM."|"mbps,t2dm,patients,sodium,parameters"|"t2dm,mbps,patients,hemodynamic,parameters" 
"AB  - Studying of apelin's activity corresponding to pronunciation of carbohydrate  disorders was provided in 136 patients with essential hypertension. General  clinical and laboratory investigations were used. In (34,46%) patients with  essential hypertension comorbid type 2 diabetes was revealed, in 37 (31,92%)  patients - pre diabetes. Significant increasing of apelin levels were estimated  in the whole group of hypertensive patients with marked expression in patients  with comorbid type 2 diabetes. Significant correlations of apelin with components  of carbohydrate pool dedicate that apelin takes part in the development of  gluco-metabolic disorders in essential hypertension."|"apelin,patients,hypertension,carbohydrate,essential"|"patients,apelin,diabetes,essential,hypertension" 
"AB  - Arterial hypertension combined with obesity is a very common form of comorbid  disease in most countries all over the world. The combination of these diseases  is characterized by mutual burdening of remodelling processes in important target  organs, what greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and  death. The mechanisms of injury progression to vital organs in essential  hypertension (EH) and obesity have some common features. The most important risk   factors of target organs damage are hemodynamic and neurohumoral: inflammatory,  effectors of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, insulin resistance and  others. Polyethiologic remodelling, lack of knowledge concerning violations in  structural and functional status of important target organs and mechanisms of the  interactions of their progression with this comorbidity require further study of   these issues. The objective of the study was the comparative study of the state  of integral indicators of structural and functional state of the heart, blood  vessels and liver in patients with EH second stage with normal body weight and  with concomitant obesity I and II degrees. This study found that the presence of   obesity I and II in patients with EH stage II is associated with the concentric  type of left ventricular hypertrophy, saved by its ejection fraction and impaired  diastolic filling processes. For the patients with EH in the early stages of  obesity the following characteristics are quite typical: considerable increase of  intima media thickness in the carotid arteries, increasing the stiffness in the  main arteries and liver parenchyma, impaired of the functional state of  endothelial."|"obesity,organs,eh,functional,important"|"obesity,eh,organs,study,functional" 
"AB  - Measurement of the aldosterone to active renin ratio (AARR) is the recommended  screening test for primary aldosteronism (PA), but several sampling conditions  impact on the AARR. We aimed to evaluate the reproducibility and the influence of  orthostasis and salt loading on the AARR. The Graz Endocrine Causes of  Hypertension (GECOH) study is a diagnostic accuracy study among hypertensive  patients at a tertiary care centre in Graz, Austria. With a median interval of 4   weeks we determined the AARR under standardized sampling conditions twice in the   sitting position, after 1h in the supine position, and after a salt infusion test  (SIT). We identified 9 patients with PA and 151 patients with essential  hypertension (EH). The Pearson correlation coefficient between both AARR  measurements in the sitting position was 0.79 (p<0.001). In EH, recumbency was  associated with a significant decrease of aldosterone and, to a lesser extent, of  renin, thus lowering the AARR as compared to the sitting position (p<0.001 for  all). In PA, recumbency had only minor effects, but it increased the rate of  false negative AARR. SIT suppressed the AARR and its components in EH, whereas in  PA only renin was slightly decreased. AARR has a good intra-individual  reproducibility and decreases during recumbency. These results suggest that a  single AARR determination in the sitting position is a reliable screening tool  for PA."|"aarr,pa,position,sitting,eh"|"aarr,pa,position,sitting,eh" 
"AB  - Increased blood pressure variability (BPV) contributes to end-organ damage,  cardiovascular events and mortality associated with hypertension. In a cohort of   2780 hypertensive patients treated by either calcium channel blockers (CCBs),  diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers alone or in combination, we compared indices of   short-term BPV according to the different treatments. Short-term BPV was  calculated as the standard deviation (s.d.) of 24 h, daytime or nighttime  systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP). Short-term  BPV was compared between patients treated with a given antihypertensive class of   interest (alone or in combination) and those not treated with this class, after  controlling for ambulatory average blood pressure, heart rate, age, gender,  propensity scores and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Patients treated with   CCBs (n=1247) or diuretics (n=1486) alone, or in addition to other drugs had  significant lower s.d. of 24-h SBP compared with those not treated with these  classes (mean differences in s.d. -0.50+/-0.50 mm Hg, P=0.001 and -0.17+/-0.15 mm  Hg, P=0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference regarding  treatment with or without ARBs, ACEIs and beta-blockers. The combinations of CCBs  with diuretics or ARBs on top of other treatments resulted in a lower 24-h SBP  variability (mean differences in s.d. -0.43+/-0.17 mm Hg, P=0.02 and -0.44+/-0.19  mm Hg, P=0.005 vs. other combination uses, respectively). Antihypertensive drug  classes have differential effects on short-term BPV with a greater reduction in  patients treated with CCBs and diuretics. The combinations of CCBs with diuretics  may be the most efficient treatments in lowering BPV."|"bpv,treated,pressure,diuretics,short"|"bpv,treated,ccbs,diuretics,blockers" 
"AB  - We addressed a question if there is a relationship between severity of newly  diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and markers of cardiovascular alterations  in middle-aged untreated hypertensive patients. In 121 consecutive patients with   never-treated essential hypertension (mean age 35.9+/-10.1 years; 97 men and 24  women) evaluation of office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements,  metabolic syndrome (MS) components and markers of alterations in cardiovascular  system including left ventricular structure and function, carotid artery wall  intima-media thickness (cIMT) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was performed.   OSA was classified as mild (apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) 5-15 events h(-1)) or  moderate-to-severe (AHI >15 events h(-1)). Mild and moderate-to-severe OSA were  diagnosed in 30% and 20% of patients, respectively. No differences in nighttime  BP levels and decline between patients with and without OSA were observed. The  patients with moderate-to-severe OSA were characterized by higher cIMT  (0.74+/-0.16 vs. 0.60+/-0.15 mm; P=0.001), UAE (14.5+/-6.9 vs. 10.0+/-8.0 mg 24  h(-1); P=0.014), relative wall thickness (0.42+/-0.05 vs. 0.39+/-0.05; P=0.023)  and by a higher degree of diastolic dysfunction (E'-wave velocity 11.4+/-3.2 vs.   15.5+/-3.8 m s(-1); P<0.001) as compared with the patients without OSA. In  multivariate analysis, AHI independently of BP and MS components correlated with   UAE, relative wall thickness and E'-wave velocity. In the middle-aged  never-treated hypertensive patients, moderate-to-severe OSA correlates with  markers of cardiovascular alterations independently of BP levels and MS  components."|"osa,patients,bp,cardiovascular,markers"|"osa,patients,15,bp,moderate" 
"AB  - Abnormal left ventricle (LV) geometric patterns are associated with an increased   risk of vascular complications of hypertension (HT). The association between  red-cell distribution width (RDW) and HT has been recently investigated; however,  the relationship between abnormal LV geometric patterns and RDW has not been  studied before. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between  RDW and abnormal LV geometric patterns in patients with untreated essential HT.  Measurements were obtained from 139 patients with untreated essential HT (mean  age=51.3+/-16.3 years). Four different geometric patterns (NG, normal geometry;  CR, concentric remodeling; EH, eccentric hypertrophy; CH, concentric hypertrophy)  were determined according to the LV mass index (LVMI) and relative wall thickness  (RWT). RDW, lipid parameters and other biochemical markers were measured in all  patients. While the highest RDW values were detected in the CH group (P<0.05, for  all), it was similar among the NG, CR and EH groups (P>0.05, for all). RDW was  associated with age, LVMI and LV geometry in bivariate analysis (P<0.05, for  all). In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a level of  RDW>14.5 predicted CH with 81% sensitivity and 59% specificity. Age (beta=0.309,   P=0.001), LV geometry type (beta=0.228, P=0.01) and RWT (beta=-0.278; P=0.25)  were independent predictors of high RDW in multiple linear regression analysis.  In conclusion, the highest RDW values were observed in the CH group in the  untreated essential HT patients. RDW seems to be a useful tool for the prediction  of end-organ damage in patients with untreated essential HT."|"rdw,lv,ht,patients,patterns"|"rdw,ht,lv,patients,ch" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of studies assessing abnormal glucose  metabolism (AGM) prevalence among patients with primary aldosteronism (PA),  calculating a combined pooled prevalence and summarizing metabolic parameters  associated the pooled prevalence for comparative group. METHOD: Four electronic  databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ISI-Web of Science) were  systematically retrieved with no language and time restriction. Studies about  elevated level of glucose metabolism in primary aldosteronism were included.  RESULT: Data were available in 16 studies. The pooled analysis revealed that the   prevalence of elevated glucose in PA was 22.41 % (95 % CI 16.77-28.05 %), the  retrospectively calculated prevalence was 31.20 % (95 % CI 15.81-46.60 %) for  impaired fasting glucose, 26.19 % (95 % CI 15.17-37.21 %) for impaired glucose  tolerance, 15.22 % (95 % CI 9.93-20.51 %) for diabetes mellitus. Prevalence of  AGM in PA was higher than that in essential hypertension (OR = 1.55, 95 % CI  1.01-2.36, p = 0.04). From comparative groups, patients with primary  aldosteronism had a lower level of insulin sensitivity indicators in comparison  with normal group (p < 0.01). On the other hand, insulin resistance which  presented by HOMA index was stronger in PA group than in normal control group  (WMD = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.17, 0.65; p = 0.001), whereas it was weaker than that in  EH group (WMD = -0.37, 95 % CI -0.62, -0.13; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: There is a  significant prevalence of elevated level of glucose metabolism in patients with  PA. Awareness and treatment of this pre-diabetic or diabetic state are necessary."|"prevalence,pa,group,glucose,studies"|"95,ci,prevalence,glucose,group" 
"AB  - MicroRNAs (miRs), as essential gene expression regulators, modulate  cardiovascular development and disease and thus they are emerging as potential  biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease, including  hypertension. We assessed the expression levels of the microRNAs miR-9 and  miR-126 in 60 patients with untreated essential hypertension and 29 healthy  individuals. All patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography and 24-hour   ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. MicroRNA expression levels in peripheral  blood mononuclear cells were quantified by real-time reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction. Hypertensive patients showed significantly lower miR-9  (9.69 +/- 1.56 vs 41.08 +/- 6.06; P < .001) and miR-126 (3.88 +/- 0.47 vs 8.96  +/- 1.69; P < .001) expression levels compared with healthy controls. In  hypertensive patients, miR-9 expression levels showed a significant positive  correlation (r = 0.437; P < .001) with left ventricular mass index. Furthermore,   both miR-9 (r = 0.312; P = .015) and miR-126 (r = 0.441; P < .001) expression  levels in hypertensive patients showed significant positive correlations with the  24-hour mean pulse pressure. Our data reveal that miR-9 and miR-126 are closely  related to essential hypertension in humans, as they show a distinct expression  profile in hypertensive patients relative to healthy individuals, and they are  associated with clinical prognostic indices of hypertensive target-organ damage  in hypertensive patients. Thus, they may possibly represent potential biomarkers   and candidate therapeutic targets in essential hypertension."|"patients,expression,hypertensive,mir,essential"|"mir,expression,patients,hypertensive,levels" 
"AB  - Achieving adequate blood pressure (BP) control with antihypertensive medication  remains an elusive goal for many patients. The advances in knowledge of  hypertension and the increasingly improved upon therapeutic strategies seem not  to guarantee even sustainable control rates at the population level. In addition,  patients who either discontinue their medications or are non-adherent to drug  therapy run the risk of developing uncontrolled BP. Number of daily tablets more   than two and number of daily drug administration at least three have been  associated with poor adherence with drug therapy. However, BP control seems to go  beyond adherence with drug therapy as there are other associated factors. Studies  have demonstrated beneficial effect of aerobic exercise in the prevention and  management of hypertension. It appears, however, that the majority of these  studies failed to explore the possible additive or synergistic effect of aerobic   exercise on antihypertensive drugs such that fewer drugs would be required to  achieve BP control or that the BP control rate would be increased with the same  number of drugs. This review presents the evidence for poor BP control in the  general population, and the possible means and process of aerobic exercise  complementing antihypertensive drug therapy in order to achieve higher BP control  rates."|"bp,control,drug,therapy,antihypertensive"|"bp,control,drug,therapy,aerobic" 
"AB  - Increased blood pressure variability (BPV) is correlated with adverse  cardiovascular (CV) events in adults. However, there has been limited research on  its effect in the pediatric population. Additionally, BPV differences between  primary and secondary hypertension (HTN) are not known. Children with primary and  secondary HTN underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and  echocardiography studies. BPV measures of standard deviation (SD), average real  variability (ARV), and range were calculated for the 24-hour, daytime, and  nighttime periods. Seventy-four patients (median age, 13.5 years; 74% boys) were   examined, 40 of whom had primary HTN. Body mass index z score and age were  independent predictors of systolic ARV (R(2) =0.14) and SD (R(2) =0.39). There  were no statistically significant differences in overall or wake period BPV  measures between secondary or primary HTN groups, but sleep period diastolic SD  was significantly greater in the secondary HTN group (9.26+/-3.8 vs 7.1+/-2.8,  P=.039). On multiple regression analysis, secondary HTN was associated with  increased sleep period diastolic SD (P=.025). No metrics of BPV in the overall,  wake, and sleep periods were found to be significantly associated with left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The results of this study do not show a strong  relationship between overall or wake BPV with primary vs secondary HTN, but the  association of secondary HTN with sleep period diastolic BPV deserves further  exploration. Contrary to expectation, the findings of this study failed to  indicate a relationship between BPV and LVH for all patients as well for primary   hypertensive and secondary hypertensive patients."|"bpv,htn,secondary,primary,sd"|"bpv,htn,secondary,primary,period" 
"AB  - Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition may exert beneficiary pleiotropic  effects on heart hemodynamics in hypertensive patients. We aimed to assess these   effects on coronary flow reserve (CFR) and left ventricular (LV) filling pressure  after acute and long-term treatment. Thirty-nine patients (48.4+/-6.8 years) with  newly diagnosed, never-treated essential arterial hypertension were consecutively  recruited from an outpatient hypertension clinic. CFR in the left anterior  descending artery and the ratio of mitral inflow E wave to the averaged mitral  annulus tissue velocity of the E waves (E/e' ratio), as an estimate of LV filling  pressure, were assessed by Doppler echocardiography. In the acute phase of the  study, consecutive eligible patients were assigned to receive po Quinapril (Q) 20  mg (n=15) or Losartan (L) 100 mg (n=14) or no treatment (n=10) and were  reexamined 2 h post treatment. In the chronic phase of the study, the patients  were reevaluated after 1 month on the assigned treatment. During the acute phase,  CFR (P=0.005) was significantly improved in the RAS inhibition as compared with  the control group, independently of blood pressure (BP) changes. The E/e' ratio  was also marginally improved (P=0.053), but this effect was more pronounced in  patients with E/e' ratio>8 (P=0.005). CFR and E/e' ratio were also improved after  1 month of treatment, particularly in responders after the acute phase. In  hypertensive patients, RAS inhibition acutely improved CFR and E/e' ratio  independently of BP changes. An acute positive response in these parameters was  closely related to sustained improvement after 1 month of single-drug treatment."|"patients,ratio,cfr,acute,treatment"|"patients,ratio,treatment,acute,cfr" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the -344C/T polymorphism in the CYP11B2  gene is involved in the development of hypertension. However, the results have  been inconsistent. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the  association of -344C/T polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene with hypertension risk in  the Chinese population. METHODS: Published literature from PubMed, Chinese  National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wan Fang data were retrieved. Pooled  odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a  fixed or random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies (8482 cases/8560  controls) were included in the final meta-analysis. Overall, there was a  significant association between -344T/C polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene and  hypertension in the Chinese (heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR=1.10, 95%  CI=1.03-1.17, I (2)=12.7%, p for heterogeneity=0.271; dominant model: OR=1.11,  95% CI=1.02-1.20, I (2)=32.1%, p for heterogeneity=0.051; allelic model: OR=1.08,  95% CI 1.01-1.16, p for heterogeneity=0.006). In the stratified analysis, the  effect size was significant only in the Han Chinese (heterogeneous co-dominant  model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.03-1.20, I (2)=0.0%, p for heterogeneity=0.745; dominant  model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.02-1.21, I (2)=18.1%, p for heterogeneity=0.299; allelic  model: OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.18, p=0.028), but not in the minority Chinese.  CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that the -344T/C polymorphism in the CYP11B2  gene was significantly associated with hypertension in the Chinese population,  especially in the Han Chinese."|"chinese,hypertension,polymorphism,analysis,gene"|"95,chinese,model,ci,heterogeneity" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between Renying pulse (carotid)  augmentation index (AI) and Cunkou pulse condition in different blood pressure  groups, and the clinical significance of Renying and Cunkou pulse parameters to  reflect vascular function. METHODS: Eighty-six patients with essential  hypertension (EH) and 52 individuals with normal blood pressure (control group)  between September 2010 and January 2012 were included in this study. Renying  pulse AI was examined by a new diagnostic tool (ALOKA ProSound Alpha 10)--wave  intensity (WI) that is calculated as the product of the derivatives of the  simultaneously recorded blood pressure changes (dP/dt) and blood-flow-velocity  changes (dU/dt), while Cunkou pulse condition was detected by DDMX-100 Pulse  Apparatus in both EH and control groups. A multifactorial correlation analysis  was performed for data analysis. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential  confounding variables, in the EH group, AI was positively correlated with t5,  w2/t (r(t5) = 0.225, P < 0.05; r(w2/t) = 0.230, P < 0.05) and negatively  correlated with h5, h5/h1 and w2 (r(h5) = -0.393, P < 0.01; r(h5)/h1) = -0.444, P  < 0.01; r(w2) = -0.389, P < 0.01).

In the   total sample group (EH plus control group, n = 138), AI was positively correlated  with t, t5, w1 and w2t (r(t) = 0.257, P < 0.01; r(t5) = 0.266, P < 0.01; r(w1) =   0.184, P < 0.05; r(w2/t) = 0.210, P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with h5,  h5/h1, w2 and Ad (r(h5) = -0.230, P < 0.01; r(h5/h1) = -0.218, P < 0.05; r(w2) =   -0.267, P < 0.01; rAd = -0.246, P < 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis  was carried out to model the relationship (F = 7.887, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION:  Renying pulse AI can effectively predict arterial stiffness in synchrony with the  manifestations of Cunkou pulse in elderly patients with hypertension. Cunkou  pulse apparatus is a valuable tool for evaluating AI in clinical practice.

SUBJECTS AND  METHODS: The study population comprised 40 normotensives/controls, (23 males and   17 females) aged between 20-70 years, with a mean blood pressure 116/75mmHg, 30  well-controlled hypertensive patients, diastolic BP <100mmHg or MAP (mean  arterial pressure) = 110mmHg and 30 poorly controlled hypertensive patients,  diastolic blood pressure > 100mmHg or MAP >110mmHg.Urine albumin(microalbumin)  was determined on the 8 hours overnight urine samples by ELISA method using kit  from Randox Laboratories Limited, N.Ireland Cat No. MA 1410. UAE was calculated  from the urine albumin concentration, urine volume and collection time. The intra  assay precision was determined by running 20 replicates of two kit controls in a   single batch. The coefficient of variation was 6.6% at 10.70mg/L and 4.3% at  51.20mg/L. RESULTS: The average UAE in the three groups were as follows: 12:22  +/-4.65ug/ min, 21.50 +/- 10.5ug/min and 30.10 +/- 24.25 ug/min in the control,  well controlled and poorly controlled groups respectively, 12.5% of normotensive   subjects, 40% of well controlled and 56.7% of poorly controlled patients were  found to have microalbuminuria.The UAE increased significantly with the severity   of hypertension (r = 0.32, p<0.001 for control) r = 0.38, p<00.05 for controlled   and r = 0.49 p<0.05 for poorly controlled. CONCLUSION: A timed overnight (8  hours) Urinary UAE is a preferred alternative to cumbersome 24 hours urine  collection for monitoring response to treatment in Nigerian patients with benign   essential hypertension."|"uae,urine,controlled,hours,patients"|"controlled,urine,patients,uae,hours" 
"AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension remains a significant risk factor in  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present study was to  investigate the effects of 8 weeks interval training programme on blood pressure,  aerobic capacity (VO max), indices of adiposity and marker of inflammation in  black African men with essential hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred   and forty five (245) male subjects with stage 1 and 2 (systolic blood pressure  [SBP] between 140-179 & diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 90-109 mmHg)  essential hypertension were age matched and grouped into experimental and control  groups. The experimental (n=140; 58.90 +/- 7.35 years) group involved in an 8  weeks interval training (60-79% HRmax) programme of between 45 and 60 minutes,  while age-matched control hypertensive (n=105; 58.27+/-6.24 years) group remain  sedentary during this period. All subjects in both groups were on  antihypertensive drugs throughout the study period. Cardiovascular parameters  (SBP, DBP) & VO max and percent body fat [%BF], waist to hip ratio [WHR] and  C-reactive protein [CRP] were assessed. Independent t-test and Pearson  correlation test were used in data analysis. RESULTS: Findings of the study  revealed significant decreased effects of interval training programme on SBP,  DBP, %BF, WHR and CRP and significant increased effect on VO max at p< 0.05.  Also, changes in CRP as a result of exercise training significantly and  positively correlated with changes in SBP, DBP, %BF, WHR, CRP and negatively  correlated with VO max at p< 0.05."|"significant,vo,crp,training,max"|"crp,dbp,max,sbp,training" 
"AB  - Blood Pressure screening in children and adolescents is currently recommended by   several prominent medical organizations, including the American Heart  Association, the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, the National  Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the European Society of Hypertension, and the  American Academy of Pediatrics. This practice was recently subject to intense  scientific review by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The conclusion of  the Task Force was that "current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance  of benefits and harms of screening for primary hypertension in asymptomatic  children and adolescents." This commentary provides an alternate interpretation  of current evidence for blood pressure screening in children and adolescents and   highlights its importance as a part of routine medical care."|"blood,adolescents,screening,children,american"|"blood,adolescents,children,pressure,screening" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: ABO genetic polymorphisms have recently been associated with  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and inflammation, which play a  critical role in the pathogenic mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough.  Therefore, the current study determined the association of ABO genetic  polymorphisms with enalapril-induced cough in Chinese patients with essential  hypertension. METHODS: A total of 450 essential hypertensive patients treated  with 10 mg of enalapril maleate were genotyped for ABO genetic polymorphisms  using the PCR-direct sequencing method. Cough was recorded when patients were  bothered by cough and respiratory symptoms during enalapril treatment without an   identifiable cause. RESULTS: The distribution of rs8176740 and rs495828 was  different between the coughers and the controls [P=0.039; odds ratio (OR)=0.70,  P=0.018; OR=1.41]. The risk of enalapril-induced cough in the rs495828 TT  carriers was increased (P=0.008; OR=2.69), which remained significant after false  discovery rate correction. The results for the rs8176740 polymorphism were  significant in the female subgroup (P=0.027; OR=0.22). Haplotype analysis of the   four ABO polymorphisms (rs8176746/rs8176740/rs495828/rs12683493) showed that the   frequency of the GATC haplotype was higher in the coughers than those in the  controls (26.6 vs. 18.8%, P=0.033; OR=1.43). CONCLUSION: The rs495828  polymorphism was associated with enalapril-induced cough and may serve as a  useful pharmacogenomics marker of the safety of enalapril in Chinese patients  with essential hypertension. The mechanism for the associations may involve the  effects of the ABO gene or ABO blood type on ACE activity and inflammation."|"cough,enalapril,abo,polymorphisms,rs495828"|"abo,cough,enalapril,induced,patients" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effects of essential hypertension treated with  acupuncture at Siguan [Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong (LR 3)], Quchi (LI 11) and  Xingjian (LR 2). METHODS: Sixty cases of essential hypertension were randomly  divided into an acupuncture group and a medication group, 30 cases in each group.  Two groups of acupoint, which were (1) Siguan [Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong (LR 3)]  and (2) Quchi (LI 11), Xingjian (LR 2), were selected alternatively in the  acupuncture group, once everyday. In the medication group, captopril was  prescribed for oral administration 25 mg per time, three times per day. Seven  days made one session in both groups and totally three sessions were required.  RESULTS: (1) After treatment, the blood pressure were decreased significantly in   the two groups (all P < 0.01). Compared with the medication group, the diastolic   pressure after 14 days, 21 days of treatment in the acupuncture group was  decreased significantly (both P < 0.01). (2) In the terms of TCM syndrome score,   the improvement of dizziness, soreness and weakness of waist and knees,  palpitations was significant in the acupuncture group compared with that in the  medication group(all P < 0.05). (3) The acupuncture group had less adverse  reactions compared with the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at   Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR 3), Quchi (LI 11) and Xingjian (LR 2) can effectively  decrease blood pressure; the effect of controlling diastolic pressure is better  than captopril. It can also improve the symptoms of dizziness, soreness and  weakness of waist and knees, and palpitations."|"group,acupuncture,pressure,groups,lr"|"group,acupuncture,lr,li,medication" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it   is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular  morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has   not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether  individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood  pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the  dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide  diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary  hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading  to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric  acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946  to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of  3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension. DATA   COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed  trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data  for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous  outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval   (CI). MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated  the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different  thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight  weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure   was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available  for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%)  included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our  confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.In 33 trials with a baseline  blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based   on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood  pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality  evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to   7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg  (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality  evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to   7, low-quality evidence), respectively.Direct comparison of doses did not show  evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other  thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone,  cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.In seven trials with a baseline blood   pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced   average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14,  low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).In 10 trials  with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to  5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10,   low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).We judged the  maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar.   Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg  (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality  evidence).Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on  diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6  mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting   enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin  inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based  on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews   on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used  similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.Thiazides reduced  potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.  These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide.  Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other  thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does  not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there  was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a  dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering  effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3  mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest   doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it   more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure,  thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg   pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors,  and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown  in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes  with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.Thiazides did not  increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there   is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased  uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides."|"pressure,blood,dose,thiazides,mmhg"|"mmhg,pressure,blood,evidence,95" 
"AB  - The transition from healthy myocardium to hypertensive heart disease is  characterized by a series of poorly understood changes in myocardial tissue  microstructure. Incremental alterations in the orientation and integrity of  myocardial fibers can be assessed using advanced ultrasonic image analysis. We  used a modified algorithm to investigate left ventricular myocardial  microstructure based on analysis of the reflection intensity at the  myocardial-pericardial interface on B-mode echocardiographic images. We evaluated  the extent to which the novel algorithm can differentiate between normal  myocardium and hypertensive heart disease in humans as well as in a mouse model  of afterload resistance. The algorithm significantly differentiated between  individuals with uncomplicated essential hypertension (N = 30) and healthy  controls (N = 28), even after adjusting for age and sex (P = 0.025). There was a   trend in higher relative wall thickness in hypertensive individuals compared to  controls (P = 0.08), but no difference between groups in left ventricular mass (P  = 0.98) or total wall thickness (P = 0.37). In mice, algorithm measurements (P =   0.026) compared with left ventricular mass (P = 0.053) more clearly  differentiated between animal groups that underwent fixed aortic banding,  temporary aortic banding, or sham procedure, on echocardiography at 7 weeks after  surgery. Based on sonographic signal intensity analysis, a novel imaging  algorithm provides an accessible, non-invasive measure that appears to  differentiate normal left ventricular microstructure from myocardium exposed to  chronic afterload stress. The algorithm may represent a particularly sensitive  measure of the myocardial changes that occur early in the course of disease  progression."|"algorithm,myocardial,ventricular,left,microstructure"|"algorithm,myocardial,left,ventricular,analysis" 
"AB  - beta-Adrenergic receptor blockers or beta-blockers represent one of the oldest  classes of cardiovascular agents and have been considered a cornerstone therapy  for hypertension and heart disease for the past 5 decades. They are advocated as   a first-line treatment for uncomplicated essential hypertension in patients  younger than 60 years of age as recommended by the Canadian Hypertension  Education Program. However, despite the well-established antihypertensive and  cardiovascular benefits of beta-blockers, a number of studies argue that they  might not have the same clinical advantages of other classes of agents in terms  of morbidity/mortality outcomes. This review will focus on the heterogeneity of  the pharmacologic characteristics of beta-blockers, and we will discuss the  metabolic and hemodynamic differences within the beta-blocker class and try to  assess the potential implications of these differences for optimal selection in  hypertension."|"beta,hypertension,blockers,cardiovascular,differences"|"beta,blockers,hypertension,agents,cardiovascular" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the genetic polymorphisms of glutathione  S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1), Ile105Val of the GSTP1 (rs947894), and   the Val16Ala polymorphism of the MnSOD (rs4880) are associated with essential  arterial hypertension (EAH) in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN AND  METHODS: 1015 Slovenian subjects (Caucasians) with type 2 diabetes with/without  EAH were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Genotypes were determined by  multiplex PCR amplification and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism  method. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, GSTM1-null genotype and GSTT1-null  genotype were associated with EAH in subjects with type 2 diabetes (59.0% vs.  50.3%, p=0.007; 28.5% vs. 20.7%, p=0.008; consequently). CONCLUSION: After  adjustment for age, body mass index, and hsCRP level, GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null  genotypes were found to be independent risk factors for the development of EAH in  Slovenian patients with type 2 diabetes."|"eah,gstm1,gstt1,null,type"|"diabetes,eah,null,type,gstm1" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines for the management of hypertension recommend using drugs  with different mechanisms of action in antihypertensive regimens that include  simple single-pill fixed-dose combination (FDC) products. OBJECTIVE: The  objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the FDC  of azilsartan (AZI) and amlodipine besylate (AML) with those of AZI monotherapy  and AML monotherapy in Japanese patients with grade 1 to 2 essential  hypertension. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group study. After receiving placebo during a 4-week run-in period in a   single-blind manner, patients were randomized to receive 1 of the following 5  treatments for 8 weeks: FDC containing AZI 20 mg and AML 5 mg (AZI/AML 20/5 mg),   FDC containing AZI 20 mg and AML 2.5 mg (AZI/AML 20/2.5 mg), AZI 20 mg, AML 5 mg,  or AML 2.5 mg once daily in a fasting or fed state. The primary end point was the  change from baseline (week 0) in the seated trough diastolic blood pressure at  week 8 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]), and the secondary end point was  the change from baseline in the seated trough systolic blood pressure at week 8  (LOCF). Tolerability was assessed based on adverse events, vital signs, and  physical examination findings. RESULTS: Of the 800 patients who provided informed  consent, 603 were randomized to receive AZI/AML 20/5 mg (150 patients), AZI/AML  20/2.5 mg (151 patients), AZI 20 mg (151 patients), AML 5 mg (75 patients), or  AML 2.5 mg (76 patients). The mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was  160.7/100.3 mm Hg. The mean change from baseline in seated blood pressure at week  8 (LOCF) was -35.3/-22.3 mm Hg in the AZI/AML 20/5 mg group and -31.4/-19.2 mm Hg  in the AZI/AML 20/2.5 mg group, indicating a reduction significantly greater than  that in corresponding monotherapy groups (-21.5/-13.9 mm Hg in the AZI 20 mg  group, -26.4/-15.5 mm Hg in the AML 5 mg group, and -19.3/-11.6 mm Hg in the AML   2.5 mg group; p < 0.0001 for all contrast tests). No remarkable difference was  found in the incidences of adverse events, vital signs, and physical examination   findings among the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This study found that the FDC of  AZI/AML 20/5 mg and 20/2.5 mg exhibited greater antihypertensive effects compared  with each monotherapy. The FDC of AZI/AML had a similar safety profile to that of  each monotherapy and was tolerable to Japanese patients with grade 1 to 2  essential hypertension.

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound speckle tracking  imaging (STI) in the evaluation of the early changes in the left ventricular (LV)  twist-displacement loop in patients with hypertension (EH). METHODS: Sixty-five  EH patients with left ventricular normal geometry (LVN) - including 33 cases with  non-left atrial enlargement (NLAE) and 32 cases with left atrial enlargement  (LAE) - along with 45 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Basal and   apical 2D LV short-axis images were acquired and analyzed to obtain the LV  rotation (LVrot) and LV radial displacement. Once the LV twist and LV radial  displacement were calculated, an LV twist-displacement loop was constructed.  Group comparisons between peak twist (Ptw), twist at mitral valve opening  (MVOtw), untwisting rate (Utw R), systolic radial displacement (SD), systolic  slope (SS), isovolumic relaxation radial displacement (IVRD) and isovolumic  relaxation slope (IVRS) were performed. RESULTS: (1) The Ptw and MVOTw were  greater in the NLAE and LAE groups when compared to the normal group while the  UTw R was lower in likewise comparison. (2) The LV twist was correlated to the  radial displacement in systole and in the isovolumic relaxation period. The SS  and IVRS were greater in the NLAE and LAE groups when compared to the normal  group. CONCLUSIONS: The LV twist-displacement loop can be reconstructed  noninvasively by 2D ultrasound STI. EH affects the systolic and early diastolic  component of the twist-displacement loop by increasing the LV twist and  decreasing the LV untwisting respectively impairing LV relaxation. The assessment  of the LV twist-displacement loop may be useful in the evaluation of early  features of LV dysfunction in EH patients."|"lv,twist,displacement,loop,left"|"lv,displacement,twist,loop,radial" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a potent predictor of plaque instability  and cardiac events. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), well-known vascular calcification  mediator, is a signaling molecule involved in bone remodeling, which has been  implicated in the regulation of vascular calcification and atherogenesis. The  purpose of this study was to compare the combination treatments of  olmesartan/azelnidipine and olmesartan/diuretics on serum bone-related markers in  patients with essential hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 48 patients  with hypertension treated with 20 mg olmesartan were randomized to receive  combination treatment with 16 mg azelnidipine (O/A group) or diuretics (1 mg  indapamide; O/D group) for 12 months. Osteoprotegerin, matrix metalloproteinase 2  (MMP-2), and high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) were measured after 3 and 12 months of  treatment. Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was measured as the arterial  stiffness using a VaSera CAVI instrument at the same time points. In both groups,  the systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction is similar. Serum OPG, MMP-2,  and hs-CRP were significantly decreased at 12 months in the O/A group (P < .05),   while there were no significant reductions in the O/D group. CAVI was  significantly improved at 12 months in both the treatment groups. The improvement  in CAVI was significantly greater in the O/A group than in the O/D group.  CONCLUSION: Azelnidipine, but not indapamide, combined with olmesartan, improved   arterial stiffness and were associated with significant decrease in OPG, MMP-2,  and hs-CRP concentrations. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of  the combination treatments of olmesartan/azelnidipine on arterial stiffness are  mediated by alteration in bone-remodeling and inflammatory markers."|"vascular,olmesartan,cavi,bone,calcification"|"group,olmesartan,12,azelnidipine,cavi" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for target organ damage. The  brain is among the target organs infrequently visited. The authors evaluated  whether an abnormal Mini-Mental Score Examination (MMSE) score predicts  uncontrolled hypertension even if office blood pressure is normal. Seventy-seven   hypertensive patients were included. The cognitive function of each patient was  assessed using MMSE and a customized brain magnetic resonance imaging study.  Patients were classified into normal cognitive function group and mild, moderate,  and severe cognitive impairment groups. A significance level of P=.05 was used.  There was a higher percentage of uncontrolled BP in every cognitive impairment  class. In patients older than 65 years, MMSE score had a sensitivity and  specificity of 94% and 83%, respectively, in the prediction of uncontrolled  hypertension. MMSE is a simple test to run in the clinic to predict whether  patients have well-controlled blood pressure."|"mmse,patients,cognitive,uncontrolled,hypertension"|"cognitive,mmse,patients,hypertension,score" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: This study aims to investigate the role of osteopontin (OPN) genetic   polymorphisms in the occurrence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in Chinese   patients with essential hypertension (EH). A total of 1,092 patients diagnosed  with EH were recruited. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on the  promoter region of the OPN gene, including -66T/G, -156G/GG, and -443C/T were  genotyped. The serum thrombin-cleaved OPN levels were studied. Patients were  divided into LVH+ (n = 443) and the LVH- (n = 649) groups. We found that none of   the studied SNPs in the OPN gene was associated with the risk and severity of  LVH. The SNPs in the OPN gene did not correlate with the serum OPN levels.  However, the serum thrombin-cleaved OPN levels were found to be an independent  risk factor for LVH in the EH patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis  showed that serum thrombin-cleaved OPN levels were independently associated with   the development of LVH (adjusted OR = 2.47, 95 % CI 1.56-4.01, adjusted P <  0.001). In vitro studies showed that the thrombin-cleaved OPN treatment increased  the protein content per cell, the cardiomyocyte surface size, and the expression   level of atrial natriuretic peptide protein in a dose-dependent manner. The  thrombin-cleaved OPN serum level, but not OPN gene polymorphism, is associated  with the development of LVH in EH patients. KEY MESSAGES: Serum OPN is related to  LVH incidence in essential hypertension subjects. OPN stimulates cardiomyocyte  hypertrophy in vitro. OPN SNPs are not related to LVH incidence."|"opn,lvh,patients,serum,thrombin"|"opn,lvh,serum,cleaved,patients" 
"AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the vasomotor activity of skin precapillary   arterioles, depending on the condition of blood outflow from the capillary bed in  patients with essential arterial hypertension (AH). The study included 30  normotensive subjects (NT) and 63 patients with AH, who were tested with a laser   Doppler flowmetry with wavelet analysis of blood flow oscillations on the right  forearm and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on the left shoulder.  Antihypertensive therapy was stopped for all patients 14 days prior to the  experiment or AH was diagnosed for the first time. The hypertensive patients were  divided into 2 groups, depending on the amplitude of the respiratory blood flow  oscillations in skin microvessels. The first group included 30 patients without  blood outflow violations of the capillary bed (AHVN), the second group consisted   of 33 patients with various intensity of functional disorders in venular sector  of microvasculature (AHVS). If the value of the amplitude of blood flow  oscillations can be related to the tone" definition, then AHVN patients have a  significant increase in neurogenic component of vascular tone (p<0.002) and  violation of microvessel vasomotor endothelial function (p=0.065) in regard to  NT, and AHVS patients to NT have a significant reduction of myogenic component  tone of precapillary arterioles (p<0.05). AHVN patients compared to AHVS patients  have a higher precapillary arteriolar tone due to endothelial (p<0.01),  neurogenic (p<0.01) and myogenic (p<0.01) components of the vascular tone.  Despite the lower values of the precapillary arteriolar tone, AHVS patients have   higher BP values both at daytime (p<0.0005), and in nocturnal hours (p<0.05), and  the functional state of venular sector is connected with nocturnal BP reduction.   Obtained results indicate that hypertensive patients can have significant  differences in the functional state of microvessels. The assessment of the  initial skin microvasculatory regulatory mechanism status could potentially be  useful for individual choice of antihypertensive therapy."|"patients,blood,tone,precapillary,skin"|"patients,blood,tone,ahvs,precapillary" 
"AB  - Vascular oxidative stress is an important factor in hypertension-associated  vascular damage and is mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  (NADPH) oxidase activation. The C242T polymorphism at the p22PHOX gene affects  binding of p22PHOX to heme, leading to variants of NADPH oxidase that produce  different levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specific variations in ROS are  associated with an altered risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In the  present study, 140 permanent Kashmiri-resident individuals were recruited (75  with essential systemic hypertension and 65 normotensive controls). Endothelial  function was assessed non-invasively using high-resolution ultrasonography of the  brachial artery. Endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity was expressed in terms of  flow-mediated dilation. The TT genotype was identified in 2% of hypertensive and   7% of normotensive individuals. Frequency of the T-allele was not observed as  significantly different between hypertensive and normotensive individuals  (P=0.24; OR=0.4; 95% CI, 0.07-2.2). Blood pressure or the prevalence of  hypertension did not vary between C242T p22PHOX genotypes or in the presence or  absence of the T-allele."|"hypertension,p22phox,normotensive,individuals,associated"|"hypertension,individuals,normotensive,p22phox,allele"

According to blood pressure reduction rate   at night, the hypertensive patients were divided into non-dipper group (NDH  group, n=54) with a reduction rate of <10% and dipper group (DH group, n=48) with  a reduction rate of >/=10%. The circadian blood pressure rhythm and heart rate  variability were measured with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour  electrocardiograph monitoring, respectively, and MEE was measured by Doppler  echocardiography to analyze their correlations. RESULTS: SDNN, SDANN, SDNNindex,   RMSSD, PNN50, and HF were significantly lower in the hypertensive patients than  in the control group (P<0.05); these parameters, except for PNN50, were all  significantly lower in NDH group than in DH group (P<0.05). The hypertensive  patients had significantly higher MEE than the control group (P<0.05), and MEE  was significantly higher in NDH group than in DH group (P<0.05). Bivariate  correlation analysis showed significant correlations of MEE with SDANN in the  hypertensive patients (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with primary hypertension,  especially those in NDH group, have impaired autonomic nervous system function.  The hypertensive patients in NDH group show a more prominent increase in MEE in  relation to sympathetic activation, suggesting the importance of restoring  circadian blood pressure rhythm in the treatment of hypertension."|"mee,hypertensive,patients,group,blood"|"group,patients,hypertensive,mee,blood" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Primary aldosteronism (PA), the most frequent form of  secondary hypertension, is characterized by a higher rate of cardiovascular (CV)   events than essential hypertension (EH). Aim of the study was to evaluate the  cardiovascular risk according to the ESH/ESC 2007 guidelines, in patients with PA  and with EH, at diagnosis and after treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We  prospectively studied 102 PA patients (40 with aldosterone producing adenoma-APA   and 62 with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism-IHA) and 132 essential hypertensives at  basal and after surgical or medical treatment (mean follow-up period 44 months  for PA and 42 months for EH). At baseline evaluation the stratification of CV  risk was significantly different: the predominant risk category was the high CV  risk (50% in total PA, 53% in PA matched for blood pressure values and 55% in  EH), but the very high risk category was twice in PA than in EH patients (36% in   total PA and 33% in matched PA vs. 17% in EH, p < 0.05). The worse risk profile  of PA was due to a higher prevalence of glycemic alterations, metabolic syndrome   and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p < 0.05). After adequate treatment, the   CV risk was significantly reduced becoming comparable in PA and in EH patient due  to a reduction of hypertension grading, prevalence of metabolic syndrome,  hypertension persistence and LVH (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with PA present  a high CV risk, which is in part reversible after specific treatment, due both to  the reduced blood pressure values and to the improvement of end-organ damage."|"pa,eh,risk,cv,treatment"|"pa,risk,eh,cv,hypertension" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Normoglucosetolerants (NGT) are considered at low risk, even  if a 1-h post-load glucose (PLG) value >/= 155 mg dl(-1) identifies NGTs at high   risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D) and sub-clinical organ damage. Specific dietary  factors may affect insulin sensitivity and the risk of T2D. However, it is  unknown whether dietary components affect 1-h PLG in hypertensive NGT. Therefore,  we investigate the effect of dietary patterns on 1-h PLG. METHODS AND RESULTS: We  selected 188 subjects (94 NGTs < 155 mg dl(-1) and 94 NGTs >/= 155 mg dl(-1)  PLG), well matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Insulin sensitivity  was evaluated using the Matsuda index. Dietary intake was quantified by a  semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FEQ) validated in the European  Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The NGT >/= 155 group had  significantly reduced insulin sensitivity (40.3 +/- 19.8 vs. 73.3 +/- 28.8; P <  0.0001). With the exclusion of total calories, lipids, alcohol and fiber  consumption we observed a significant difference, between groups, in starch  (214.1 +/- 52.4 vs. 268.8 +/- 71.8 g; P < 0.0001), saturated (27.4 +/- 8.7 vs.  24.1 +/- 8.5 g; P = 0.009), monounsaturated (45.5 +/- 8.9 vs. 48.8 +/- 10.7 g; P   = 0.023) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) (14.5 +/- 4.0 vs. 16.8 +/- 4.7 g;   P < 0.0001), fructose (14.5 +/- 5.3 vs. 11.2 +/- 4.8 g; P < 0.0001), and  oligosaccharides (103.2 +/- 26.6 vs. 89.9 +/- 29.2 g; P = 0.001) consumption. In   the whole population, starch was the major predictor of 1-h PLG, explaining 23.2%  of variation (P < 0.0001). In the NGT < 155 group, fructose was the strongest  predictor, accounting for 15.4% of the variation; BMI, gender and polyunsaturated  FAs added another 6.6%, 3.6% and 3.2%, respectively. In the NGT >/= 155 group,  saturated and polyunsaturated FAs were retained as the major predictors of 1-h  PLG, explaining 18.2% and 11.4% of the variation. CONCLUSIONS: The present data  demonstrate that dietary patterns affect 1-h PLG, remarking the importance of  both quantitative and qualitative composition of a diet."|"plg,dietary,ngt,risk,affect"|"plg,vs,155,0001,dietary" 
"AB  - Purine nucleotide liberation and their metabolic rate of interconversion may be  important in the development of hypertension and its renal consequences. In the  present study, blood triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and  adenosine monophosphate (AMP) breakdown pathway was evaluated in relation to uric  acid concentration and xanthine dehydrogenase/xanthine oxidase (XDH/XO) in  patients with essential hypertension, patients with chronic renal diseases on  dialysis, and control individuals. The pattern of nucleotide catabolism was  significantly shifted toward catabolic compounds, including ADP, AMP, and uric  acid in patients on dialysis program. A significant fall of ATP was more  expressed in a group of patients on dialysis program, compared with the control  value (p<0.001), while ADP and AMP were significantly increased in both groups of  patients compared with control healthy individuals (p<0.001), together with their  final degradation product, uric acid (p<0.001). The index of ATP/ADP and ATP/uric  acid showed gradual significant fall in both the groups, compared with the  control value (p<0.001), near five times in a group on dialysis. Total XOD was  up-regulated significantly in a group with essential hypertension, more than in a  group on dialysis. The activity of XO, which dominantly contributes reactive  oxygen species (ROS) production, significantly increased in dialysis group, more   than in a group with essential hypertension. In conclusion, the examination of  the role of circulating purine nucleotides and uric acid in pathogenesis of  hypertension and possible development of renal disease, together with XO role in   ROS production, may help in modulating their liberation and ROS production in  slowing progression from hypertension to renal failure."|"hypertension,dialysis,uric,acid,patients"|"dialysis,group,hypertension,acid,patients" 
"AB  - Oxidative stress and suppressed H2S production lead to increased renal vascular  resistance, disturbed glomerular hemodynamics, and abnormal renal sodium and  water handling, contribute to the pathogenesis and maintenance of essential  hypertension in man and the spontaneously hypertensive rat. This study  investigated the impact of H2S and tempol alone and in combination on blood  pressure and renal hemodynamics and excretory functions in the SHR. Groups of WKY  rats or SHR (n=6) were treated for 4 weeks either as controls or received NaHS  (SHR+NaHS), tempol (SHR+Tempol), or NaHS plus tempol (SHR+NaHS +Tempol).  Metabolic studies were performed on days 0, 14, and 28, thereafter animals were  anaesthetized to measure renal hemodynamics and plasma oxidative and antioxidant   markers. SHR control rats had higher mean arterial blood pressure (140.0 +/- 2  vs. 100.0 +/- 3 mmHg), lower plasma and urinary H2S, creatinine clearance, urine   flow rate and urinary sodium excretion, and oxidative stress compared to WKY (all  p<0.05). Treatment either with NaHS or with tempol alone decreased blood pressure  and oxidative stress and improved renal hemodynamic and excretory function  compared to untreated SHR. Combined NaHS and tempol therapy in SHRs caused larger  decreases in blood pressure ( approximately 20-22% vs. approximately 11-15% and  approximately 10-14%), increases in creatinine clearance, urinary sodium  excretion and fractional sodium excretion and up-regulated the antioxidant status  compared to each agent alone (all p<0.05). These findings demonstrated that H2S  and tempol together resulted in greater reductions in blood pressure and  normalization of kidney function compared with either compound alone."|"renal,tempol,blood,shr,h2s"|"tempol,shr,nahs,blood,pressure" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between polymorphism of ATP2B1 gene,  its interaction with smoking and susceptibility of essential hypertension.  METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to elucidate the role of ATP2B1 gene   variants related to the risk of essential hypertension. Genomic DNA was extracted  from peripheral blood leukocytes, using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN,Germany).  Two SNPs, - rs17249754 and rs6253, were examined on 1 280 patients and 1 010  healthy controls, using a Snapshot method. Statistical analyses were performed  with SPSS Windows software (version 19.0;SPSS, Chicago, IL). RESULTS: A  significant difference was found in rs17249754 allele frequency between cases and  controls (OR = 1.223, 95%CI: 1.083-1.381, P = 0.001). After adjustment for age,  sex, BMI, smoking and drinking, the difference was still statistically  significant (OR = 1.212, 95%CI:1.070-1.373, P = 0.003). In addition, data from  genotype distribution analysis under different models showed that appeared  significant associations between ATP2B1 gene polymorphism and essential  hypertension (additive model OR = 1.469, 95%CI: 1.121-1.925, P = 0.005; dominant   model OR = 1.324, 95%CI:1.029-1.704, P = 0.029;recessive model OR = 1.123,  95%CI:1.031-1.223, P = 0.008). In this study, the proportion of smokers in cases   was significantly higher than that in controls (P = 0.005), but no associations  between rs17249754-smoking interaction and essential hypertension were found  after the adjustment for gender, age, BMI and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.024,  95% CI:0.614-1.707). CONCLUSION: Our research findings showed that the  polymorphism of ATP2B1 gene rs17249754 was significantly associated with the  incidence of essential hypertension in Han population of northeastern China.  However, the interaction between rs17249754 and smoking did not seem to have  contributed to the occurrence of the essential hypertension."|"rs17249754,hypertension,essential,atp2b1,gene"|"95,ci,essential,hypertension,rs17249754" 
"AB  - Lifestyle, habits, diet, and genetics are all important factors associated with  the prevalence of hypertension. Many association studies have been performed in  the Chinese Han population, whereas data explaining the high prevalence of  hypertension in the Mongolian population remain scarce. In the present study, we   aimed to determine the factors associated with the development of essential  hypertension in Mongolians. A total of 194 hypertensive cases and 201 controls  from Dongwu County were enrolled in the study. Demographics, anthropometric and  blood biochemical parameters, food intake, lifestyle, habits, education,  occupation, and family history were recorded for each subject. Genotype and  allele frequencies of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the  kallikrein 1 (KLK1) gene were also examined. Mean body mass index, waistline,  hipline, blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, total  cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein levels were all  significantly higher in the hypertensive group (P<0.01). Hypertensives consumed  less milk, vegetables, and fruits, and had higher cigarette, alcohol, and salt  intake (P<0.05). There were also less regular physical exercisers and manual  workers among the hypertensive group (P<0.05). The mean inheritance rank of the  hypertensive group was higher than that of controls (P<0.05). There were no  differences in the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of the six  SNPs between the hypertensive and control groups (P>0.05). These results suggest   that dietary history and habits have the most important influence on the  development of essential hypertension in the Mongolian population."|"hypertensive,higher,hypertension,blood,habits"|"hypertensive,05,hypertension,blood,group" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the natriuretic   peptide precursor B (NPPB) gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.-1298 G/T   and pulse pressure (PP) of the Chinese Han population and the association between  genotype and clinical indicators of hypertension. Peripheral blood was collected   from 180 unrelated patients with hypertension and 540 healthy volunteers (control  group), and DNA was extracted to amplify the 5'-flanking region and 2 exons of  the NPPB gene by polymerase chain reaction; the fragment was sequenced after  purification. The clinical data of all subjects were recorded, the distribution  of the NPPB gene c.-1298 G/T polymorphism was determined, and differences in  clinical indicators between the two groups were evaluated. The mean arterial  pressure PP, and creatinine levels were significantly higher in the hypertension   group than in the control group (P<0.05), but no other clinical indicators  differed between the groups. There were no significant differences in genotype  frequency and distribution of the NPPB gene c.-1298 G/T polymorphism between the   hypertension group and the control group (P>0.05); in the control group, the mean  PP of individuals with the SNP c.-1298 GG genotype was greater than that of  individuals with the GT+TT genotype (P<0.05). In conclusion, there was no  significant correlation between the NPPB gene c.-1298 G/T polymorphism and the  incidence of essential hypertension in the Han population; however, the PP of the  SNP c.-1298 GG genotype was greater than that of the GT+TT genotype in the  control group."|"nppb,clinical,genotype,gene,hypertension"|"group,1298,genotype,control,gene" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite antihypertensive treatment, most hypertensive patients still  have high blood pressure (BP), notably high systolic blood pressure (SBP). The  EFFICIENT study examines the efficacy and acceptability of a single-pill  combination of sustained-release (SR) indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic, and  amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), in the management of hypertension.  METHODS: Patients who were previously uncontrolled on CCB monotherapy  (BP>/=140/90 mm Hg) or were previously untreated with grade 2 or 3 essential  hypertension (BP>/=160/100 mm Hg) received a single-pill combination tablet  containing indapamide SR 1.5 mg and amlodipine 5 mg daily for 45 days, in this  multicenter prospective phase 4 study. The primary outcome was mean change in BP   from baseline; percentage of patients achieving BP control (BP<140/90 mm Hg) was   a secondary endpoint. SBP reduction (DeltaSBP) versus diastolic BP reduction  (DeltaDBP) was evaluated (DeltaSBP/DeltaDBP) from baseline to day 45. Safety and   tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean baseline BP of 196 patients (mean   age 52.3 years) was 160.2/97.9 mm Hg. After 45 days, mean SBP decreased by 28.5  mm Hg (95% CI, 26.4 to 30.6), while diastolic BP decreased by 15.6 mm Hg (95% CI,  14.5 to 16.7). BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in 85% patients.  DeltaSBP/DeltaDBP was 1.82 in the overall population. Few patients (n = 3 [2%])  reported side effects, and most (n = 194 [99%]) adhered to treatment. CONCLUSION:  In patients who were previously uncontrolled on CCB monotherapy or untreated with  grade 2 or 3 hypertension, single-pill combination indapamide SR/amlodipine  reduced BP effectively--especially SBP--over 45 days, and was safe and well  tolerated.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute exercise may exert deleterious effects on the cardiovascular  system through a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms, including increased  platelet activation. However, the degree of exercise-induced platelet activation   in untreated hypertensive (UH) individuals as compared with normotensive (NT)  individuals has yet to be established. Furthermore, the effect of  antihypertensive treatment on exercise-induced platelet activation in essential  hypertension (EH) remains unknown. METHODS: Study 1 consisted of 30 UH and 15 NT   subjects. UH subjects who received treatment were included in study 2 and were  followed-up after a 3-month treatment period with an angiotensin II receptor  blocker (ARB; valsartan). Circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA) and  platelet P-selectin were measured as platelet activation markers at baseline,  immediately after a treadmill exercise test, and 10, 30, and 90 minutes later.  RESULTS: Maximal platelet activation was observed at 10 minutes after peak  exercise in both groups. In UH subjects, MPA levels remained increased at 30  minutes after peak exercise, despite BP fall to baseline levels. MPA levels were   significantly higher in UH subjects than NT subjects at maximal exercise and at  10 and 30 minutes of recovery. Post-treatment MPA levels increased significantly   only at 10 minutes into recovery and were similar to those of NT subjects.  CONCLUSIONS: Acute high-intensity exercise exaggerates platelet activation in  untreated patients with EH compared with NT individuals. Angiotensin II receptor   blockade with adequate BP control greatly improves exercise-induced platelet  activation in EH. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this phenomenon  depends purely on BP lowering or benefits also from the pleiotropic effects of  ARBs."|"exercise,platelet,activation,treatment,uh"|"exercise,platelet,activation,subjects,minutes" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Night blood pressure (BP) predicts patient outcomes. Variables  associated with night BP response to antihypertensive agents have not been fully   evaluated in essential hypertension. METHODS: We sought to measure night BP  responses to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), atenolol (ATEN), and combined therapy  using ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in 204 black and 281 white  essential hypertensive patients. Initial therapy was randomized; HCTZ and ATEN  once daily doses were doubled after 3 weeks and continued for 6 more weeks with  the alternate medication added for combined therapy arms. ABP was measured at  baseline and after completion of each drug. Night, day, and night/day BP ratio  responses (treatment - baseline) were compared in race/sex subgroups. RESULTS:  Baseline night systolic BP and diastolic BP, and night/day ratios were greater in  blacks than whites (P < 0.01, all comparisons). Night BP responses to ATEN were  absent and night/day ratios increased significantly in blacks (P < 0.05). At the   end of combined therapy, women, blacks, and those starting with HCTZ as opposed  to ATEN had significantly greater night BP responses (P < 0.01). Variables that  significantly associated with ATEN response differed from those that associated  with HCTZ response and those that associated with night BP response differed from  those that associated with day BP response. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, after  completion of HCTZ and ATEN therapy, women, blacks, and those who started with  HCTZ had greater night BP responses. Reduced night BP response and increased  night/day BP ratios occured with ATEN in blacks. Given the prognostic  significance of night BP, strategies for optimizing night BP antihypertensive  therapy should be considered.

"AB  - AIM: Diastolic dysfunction related to hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy  (LVH) has been shown to affect right-sided cardiac morphology and haemodynamics.   As left atrial enlargement (LAE) is a marker of chronically elevated left  ventricular (LV) filling pressure and diastolic dysfunction, we investigated the   relationship between LAE and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) in systemic  hypertension. METHODS: A total of 330 essential hypertensives, categorized  according to tertiles of left atrial (LA) diameter indexed to body surface area  were considered for the analysis. All subjects underwent a quantitative  echocardiographic examination as well as extensive clinical and laboratory  investigations. RVH was defined as anterior right ventricular (RV) wall thickness  >/= 6.0/5.5 mm in men and women, respectively, and LVH as LV mass index >/= 51/47  g/m(2.7) in men and women, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of LVH increased  across LA diameter tertiles from 21.0% to 50% and that of RVH from 26.3% to 41.8%  (p < 0.01for both). This was also the case for biventricular hypertrophy (from  10.0% to 26.0%, p < 0.01). Differences in both LV and RV structure across LA  diameter tertiles remained significant after adjusting for age, office  systolic/diastolic blood pressure and duration of hypertension. Similar results  were obtained when study population was divided according to absolute LA diameter  tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further evidence of an interaction  between left and right chambers in systemic hypertension by showing that LAE is  associated with RVH. The clinical and prognostic implications of such observation  remain be evaluated in future prospective studies."|"left,right,ventricular,diameter,lvh"|"left,diameter,la,right,rvh" 
"AB  - Acute hypertension (HTN) in hospitalized children and adolescents occurs  relatively frequently, and in some cases, if not recognized and treated promptly,  it can lead to hypertensive crisis with potentially significant morbidity and  mortality. In contrast to adults, where acute HTN is most likely due to  uncontrolled primary HTN, children and adolescents with acute HTN are more likely  to have secondary HTN. This review will briefly cover evaluation of acute HTN and  various age-specific etiologies of secondary HTN and provide more in-depth  discussion on treatment targets, potential risks of acute HTN therapy, and  available pediatric data on intravenous and oral antihypertensive agents, and it   proposes treatment schema including unique therapy of specific secondary HTN  scenarios."|"htn,acute,secondary,treatment,therapy"|"htn,acute,secondary,adolescents,children" 
"AB  - Hypertension secondary to chronic kidney disease prevails in earlier childhood  and obesity-related primary hypertension in adolescence. Both are associated with  a high risk of renal and cardiovascular morbidity. In children with chronic  kidney disease, uncontrolled hypertension may accelerate progression to end-stage  renal disease before adulthood is reached and increase a child's risk of cardiac   death a thousand-fold. Obesity-related hypertension is a slow and silent killer,   and though early markers of renal damage are recognized during childhood,  end-stage renal disease is a risk in later life. Renal damage will be a  formidable multiplier of cardiovascular risk for adults in whom obesity and  hypertension tracks from childhood. Management options to prevent renal damage  will vary for these different target groups. This review provides a summary of  the available renoprotective strategies in order to aid physicians involved in  the care of this challenging group of children."|"renal,risk,hypertension,disease,damage"|"renal,hypertension,disease,risk,childhood" 
"AB  - Presence of comorbidity in patients--that is essential hypertension and type 2  diabetes is associated with early progression of target organs affection and  cardiovascular complications. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are some of  the factors that determine the frequency of cardiovascular complications in type   2 diabetes. According to some authors, endothelial dysfunction is a link between   insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. To investigate severity of  endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension and type 2  diabetes and its correction by using a complex treatment alpha-lipoic acid we  have examined 84 patients with essential hypertension stage II and type 2  diabetes in a moderate condition before and after 6 months treatment. The  patients were divided into two groups: the first one consisted of the patients  who received only basic therapy, and another one consisted of those patients who   in addition to basic therapy received also alpha-lipoic acid in tablets at a dose  of 600 mg/day. After the investigation it was discovered that changes in the  vascular wall in patients with essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes are  characterized by increase of intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity in  the carotid arteries and abdominal aorta, decrease of endothelium-dependent  vasodilation degree and increase of the levels of proinflammatory cytokines.  Under the influence of the mentioned complex therapy in these patients it was  found some improvement of metabolic homeostasis and correction of endothelial  dysfunction. The effect on the structural and functional state of great vessels  and proinflammatory cytokines, gained due to additional prescription of  alpha-lipoic acid to the patients with essential hypertension and type 2  diabetes, was more considerable that the one which was shown in the group of  patients who received only standard therapy."|"patients,type,diabetes,hypertension,essential"|"patients,diabetes,type,essential,hypertension" 
"AB  - The potential association between arterial stiffening and circulating endothelial  progenitor cells (EPCs) in patients with essential hypertension was investigated.  Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was used to evaluate arterial stiffness in 24 patients   with essential hypertension and 19 healthy controls. Blood samples were taken and  immunostained with antibodies against the cell surface markers CD34, CD45, and  CD133. Using flow cytometry, EPCs as a population of CD45-/CD34+/CD133+ cells  were measured. Hypertensive patients were not found to have higher levels of  circulating CD45-/CD34+/CD133+ compared with the control group (0.0026%+/-0.0031%  vs 0.0023%+/-0.0023%, respectively; P=.7). Correlation analysis revealed a strong  association between the number of CD45-/CD34+/CD133+ cells and PWV (r=0.58,  P<.001), indicating that hypertensive patients with increased PWV have a greater   percentage of CD45-/CD34+/CD133+ cells. Data showed a correlation between the  number of circulating CD45-/CD34+/CD133+ cells and arterial stiffness, suggesting  that those cells might have a role in arterial remodeling."|"cd45,cd34,cells,cd133,patients"|"cd133,cd34,cd45,cells,arterial" 
"AB  - Hypertension is a significant medical and public health issue which puts an  enormous burden on health care resources and the community. It is a chronic  medical condition in which the systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) is elevated.  Serious complications including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases would  be preventable if the rise in BP with age could be prevented or diminished. The  majority of hypertensive patients require long-term treatment. Oral  antihypertensive drugs, lifestyle modification including exercise and dietary  modification are milestones for hypertension therapy. However, the control rate  of hypertension hasn't reached the expected requirements currently. "Three lows"   status quo, just low awareness, low treatment, and low control, are still the  major problems confronting modern medicine. Recently, uncontrolled factors of  blood pressure are widely concerned, which include insomnia, constipation, mood  disorders, exogenous, etc. What's more, the control strategies of hypertension  should not only pay close attention to "patient's high blood pressure", but also   to "hypertensive patient". Therefore, the treatment of uncontrolled factors of  blood pressure plays an important role in hypertensive therapy, which could be  further research priorities."|"pressure,blood,hypertension,hypertensive,treatment"|"blood,hypertension,pressure,control,hypertensive" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a serious health issue worldwide and essential  hypertension, which includes 90-95% of the cases, is influenced by both genetic  and environmental factors. Identification of these factors may help in control of  this disease. The Insertion/Deletion (I/D) polymorphism in Angiotensin-Converting  Enzyme (ACE) gene and rs2106809 (C > T) polymorphism in Angiotensin-Converting  Enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene have been reported to be associated with essential  hypertension in different populations. AIM: To investigate the association of ACE  I/D and ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphisms with essential hypertension in the  population of Odisha, an eastern Indian state. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of  246 hypertensives (159 males and 87 females) and 274 normotensives (158 males and  116 females) were enrolled in the study. Detailed anthropometric data, tobacco,  alcohol and food habits were recorded and 2 ml of venous blood was collected for   biochemical and genetic analysis. RESULTS: The DD genotype of ACE and TT genotype  of ACE2 were significantly high among female hypertensives, while T allele of  ACE2 was linked to male hypertensives. In the male population, alcohol was also  identified as a potential risk factor. CONCLUSION: Among females, ACE I/D and  ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphisms, while among males, ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphism and   alcohol consumption are associated with essential hypertension in the study  population."|"ace2,hypertension,alcohol,essential,ace"|"ace2,hypertension,ace,essential,rs2106809" 
"AB  - Comorbidity of essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes is a serious problem  connected with early affection of target organs and further cardiovascular  complications. Pathogenetic mechanisms, determining the progress of essential  hypertension, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, mostly have mutual symptoms  and lead to the progression of disease. Many investigators consider  cardiovascular pathology to be disease which has free radical nature. Activation   of free radical oxidative process and endothelial dysfunction are recognized one   of the most important pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases. To  investigate structural and functional changes of heart and vessels, state of the   pro- and antioxidant status, levels of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with  essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes we have examined 102 patients with  essential hypertension stage II and type 2 diabetes in a moderate condition.  After the investigation it was discovered that changes of cardiohemodynamics in  patients with essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes are characterized by the  following aspects: systolic function of left ventricle is conserved, concentric  hypertrophy of left ventricle predominates and also there is diastolic  dysfunction similar to disordered relaxation. Changes of blood vessel walls in  the examined patients are shown by growing intima-media thickness and pulse wave   velocity in carotid artery and aorta and also by dropping endothelium dependent  vasodilation. The mentioned structural and functional changes in heart and  magistral vessels go together with growing levels of cytokines, activation of  pro-oxidant system with suppression of antioxidant system, what is shown by  correlation connections of different intention and direction."|"diabetes,changes,type,essential,patients"|"diabetes,essential,hypertension,type,changes" 
"AB  - A recent genome-wide association study identified a locus on chromosome 16 in the  promoter region of the uromodulin (UMOD) gene that is associated with  hypertension. Here, we examined the hypertension signal with functional studies  in Umod knockout (KO) mice. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in KO  versus wild-type (WT) mice under basal conditions (KO: 116.6+/-0.3 mm Hg versus  WT: 136.2+/-0.4 mm Hg; P<0.0001). Administration of 2% NaCl did not alter  systolic blood pressure in KO mice, whereas it increased in WT mice by  approximately 33%, P<0.001. The average 24-hour urinary sodium excretion in the  KO was greater than that of WT mice (P<0.001). Chronic renal function curves  demonstrate a leftward shift in KO mice, suggesting that the relationship between  UMOD and blood pressure is affected by sodium. Creatinine clearance was increased  during salt loading with 2% NaCl in the KO mice, leading to augmented filtered  Na(+) excretion and further Na(+) loss. The difference in sodium uptake that  exists between WT and KO strains was explored at the molecular level. Urinary  tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were significantly higher in KO mice compared   with WT mice (P<0.0001). Stimulation of primary thick ascending limb of the loop   of Henle cells with exogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha caused a reduction in  NKCC2A expression (P<0.001) with a concurrent rise in the levels of UMOD mRNA  (P<0.001). Collectively, we demonstrate that UMOD regulates sodium uptake in the   thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle by modulating the effect of tumor  necrosis factor-alpha on NKCC2A expression, making UMOD an important determinant   of blood pressure control."|"ko,mice,umod,wt,sodium"|"ko,mice,umod,wt,001" 
"AB  - Epidemiologic studies have shown that healthy offspring of hypertensive patients   exhibit many features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperinsulinemia,  insulin resistance, and lipid disorders, while hypoapelinemia and hyporelaxinemia  may contribute to vascular damage that accelerates atherogenesis. The aim of this  study was to determine apelin and relaxin plasma levels in the healthy offspring   of hypertensive patients and to compare the findings with those of healthy  offspring of healthy parents, matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).  Forty-six (24 men and 22 women) healthy offspring of hypertensive patients, mean   age 18+/-3 years and BMI 22.4+/-1.4 kg/m(2) (group A), and 50 healthy offspring  of healthy parents (28 men and 22 women), mean age 18+/-3.2 years and BMI  22.6+/-1.7 kg/m(2) (group B), were studied. The apelin and relaxin plasma levels   (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method) were determined in the study  population. The two groups were matched for age, sex, and BMI. Plasma apelin  levels (6+/-3 vs 105 pg/mL, P<.001) and relaxin plasma levels (20+/-7 vs 29+/-8  pg/mL, P<.001) were significantly lower in group A compared with group B,  respectively. Our findings suggest that healthy offspring of healthy parents have  significantly lower plasma apelin and relaxin levels. This group of individuals  needs closer follow-up and further examination."|"healthy,offspring,group,plasma,levels"|"healthy,offspring,group,levels,plasma" 
"AB  - The evolution of QT interval and its dispersion (QTd) were studied in 135 newly  diagnosed nondiabetic patients, as well as the relationship between changes of  these left ventricular (LV) repolarization parameters with blood pressure (BP)  and LV mass changes, which were prospectively studied for a median period of 3.8   years. At baseline and at last follow-up visit, all patients underwent ambulatory  BP monitoring, echocardiographic assessment, and 12-lead electrocardiography. At   the end of follow-up, responders of antihypertensive treatment based on a reduced  24-hour systolic BP (n=122) exhibited a reduction in LV mass index (by 7.6 g/m2,   P<.001) and corrected QT (by 4.3, P=.038), while corrected QTd was unchanged. In   nonresponders (n=13), although no difference in LV mass index was observed,  corrected QT increased by 12.4 ms (P=.048) and corrected QTd by 8.2 ms (P=.027).   Changes in parameters of LV repolarization were related to BP changes but not to   changes of myocardial size."|"bp,lv,changes,mass,follow"|"changes,lv,bp,corrected,mass" 
"AB  - We did a subject-level meta-analysis of the changes (Delta) in blood pressure  (BP) observed 3 and 6 months after renal denervation (RDN) at 10 European  centers. Recruited patients (n=109; 46.8% women; mean age 58.2 years) had  essential hypertension confirmed by ambulatory BP. From baseline to 6 months,  treatment score declined slightly from 4.7 to 4.4 drugs per day.  Systolic/diastolic BP fell by 17.6/7.1 mm Hg for office BP, and by 5.9/3.5,  6.2/3.4, and 4.4/2.5 mm Hg for 24-h, daytime and nighttime BP (P</=0.03 for all).  In 47 patients with 3- and 6-month ambulatory measurements, systolic BP did not  change between these two time points (P>/=0.08). Normalization was a systolic BP   of <140 mm Hg on office measurement or <130 mm Hg on 24-h monitoring and  improvement was a fall of >/=10 mm Hg, irrespective of measurement technique. For  office BP, at 6 months, normalization, improvement or no decrease occurred in  22.9, 59.6 and 22.9% of patients, respectively; for 24-h BP, these proportions  were 14.7, 31.2 and 34.9%, respectively. Higher baseline BP predicted greater BP   fall at follow-up; higher baseline serum creatinine was associated with lower  probability of improvement of 24-h BP (odds ratio for 20-mumol l(-1) increase,  0.60; P=0.05) and higher probability of experiencing no BP decrease (OR, 1.66;  P=0.01). In conclusion, BP responses to RDN include regression-to-the-mean and  remain to be consolidated in randomized trials based on ambulatory BP monitoring.  For now, RDN should remain the last resort in patients in whom all other ways to   control BP failed, and it must be cautiously used in patients with renal  impairment."|"bp,patients,months,ambulatory,rdn"|"bp,hg,mm,patients,24" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) for the diagnosis of  primary aldosteronism is normally calculated with plasma renin activity (PRA) as   denominator. However, new direct renin assays that measure plasma renin  concentration (PRC) are progressively replacing PRA because these are faster,  simpler, and more reproducible. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the calculation of  ARR with a direct assay (ARRD, ng/dl/mU/l) instead of PRA (ARRP, ng/dl/ng/ml/h)  affects the rate of positive tests in patients on liberal antihypertensive  treatment. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: PRA, PRC, and plasma aldosterone  concentration (PAC) were measured in 88 patients with essential hypertension,  both in the supine position and after 60 min of active standing while on  treatment with a variety of antihypertensive medications. The same measurements  were carried out, for comparison, in 10 patients with proven  aldosterone-producing adenoma. SETTING: Single center, outpatient hypertension  clinic in a tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: In patients with essential  hypertension, median ARRP was 12 (range 0-71) in the supine position and 13  (range 0-80) after standing. The corresponding values of ARRD were 0.4 (range  0.01-3) and 0.5 (range 0.02-7.8). Between ARRP and ARRD, there was a linear,  highly significant relationship both in supine and standing position (r=0.88 and   r=0.92, respectively). Using as threshold of normalcy for ARRP a value less than   30, as it is recommended by guidelines, there were 13 (15%) and 18 (20%) false  positives, respectively in supine and standing position, whereas with the  threshold of 3.7 for ARRD, there were no false positives in recumbent position  and four (5%) after standing. Accordingly, the specificity of ARRP was 0.85 and  0.78 and that of ARRD 1 and 0.95. In 10 patients with primary aldosteronism,  median supine ARRP was 298 (range 48-1222) and ARRD 34 (range 2.8-244). Among  these patients, no false negatives were found with ARRP and just one with ARRD.  CONCLUSION: The rate of positive tests calculating ARR with PRC is lower than  with PRA, the lower rate being found in patients studied in the recumbent  position and apparently it is not affected by ongoing antihypertensive treatment."|"patients,arrp,arrd,pra,position"|"arrd,arrp,patients,position,range" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been previously demonstrated that dihydropyridine calcium  channel blockers may possess antioxidant properties and might improve vascular  structure. Combination treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor   may have additional advantages, compared with a thiazide diuretic, in this  regard. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the effects  of a short-term treatment with lercanidipine, and to compare two combination  treatments: lercanidipine + enalapril vs. lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide on   structural alterations in retinal arterioles, on skin capillary density and on  large artery distensibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty essential hypertensive   patients were included in the study and treated for 4 weeks with lercanidipine 20  mg per day orally. Then they were treated for 6 months with lercanidipine +  enalapril (n=10) or lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide (n=10) combinations.  Investigations were performed in basal condition, after appropriate washout of  previous treatments, after 4 weeks of lercanidipine monotherapy treatment, and at  the end of the combination treatment. Non-invasive measurements of wall-to-lumen   ratio (W/L) and other morphological parameters of retinal arterioles using  scanning laser Doppler flowmetry were performed (Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter,  Heidelberg Engineering). Capillary density was evaluated by capillaroscopy,  whereas pulse wave velocity and central blood pressure were assessed by the  Sphygmo-Cor device (AtCor Medical West Ryde, Australia). RESULTS: A significant  improvement of W/L and of other indices of retinal artery structure was observed   after treatment with lercanidipine alone, with a further improvement after  treatment with lercanidipine + enalapril, whereas after treatment with  lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide the improvement was no longer observed. A  similar behaviour was observed for central SBP and DBP. Capillary density was  increased only after treatment with lercanidipine + enalapril. CONCLUSION:  Lercanidipine both in monotherapy and in combination with enalapril, was able to   improve microvascular structure and to decrease central blood pressure, being  thus a useful approach for both reducing blood pressure and improving vascular  alterations in hypertension."|"lercanidipine,treatment,retinal,capillary,structure"|"lercanidipine,treatment,enalapril,combination,blood" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D plasma levels are negatively associated with blood  pressure and cardiovascular mortality, and vitamin D supplementation reduces  cardiovascular events. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) suppression may be one of  the mechanisms involved. However, there are no interventional prospective studies  demonstrating a reduction in circulating RAS components after vitamin D  treatment. METHODS: Fifteen consecutive drug-free patients with essential  hypertension and hypovitaminosis D underwent therapy with an oral dose of 25000  I.U. of cholecalciferol once a week for two months, while maintaining a  constant-salt diet. In basal conditions and at the end of the study, RAS activity  (plasma angiotensinogen, renin, PRA, angiotensin II, aldosterone and urinary  angiotensinogen) was investigated, in addition to blood pressure and plasma  vitamin D levels (25(OH)D). RESULTS: After cholecalciferol administration, all  patients exhibited normalized plasma 25(OH)D values. At the end of the study, a  reduction (p < 0.05) in plasma renin and aldosterone, and a decrement, although  not significant, of PRA and angiotensin II, was observed. No difference was found  in plasma and urinary angiotensinogen or blood pressure values. CONCLUSIONS: Our   data indicate that in essential hypertensives with hypovitaminosis D,"|"plasma,vitamin,ras,angiotensin,renin"|"plasma,vitamin,angiotensin,angiotensinogen,blood" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are commonly used to treat  various hypertensive conditions and in addition to lowering blood pressure these   drugs affect the local renal hemodynamic status, thereby influencing the  glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. The study was aimed  at determining whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can produce  significant changes in effective renal plasma flow in patients with parenchymal  renal disease and to assess whether the changes depend on the pre-existing  functional status of the kidney. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 80  subjects, 40 subjects with hypertension associated with diffuse renal parenchymal  disease and 40 subjects with essential hypertension. All study subjects underwent  the baseline effective renal plasma flow measurement and the repeated effective  renal plasma flow measurement after administration of captopril. Effective renal   plasma flow was determined by 131 I-hippuran clearance in blood samples taken at   20 and 30 minutes. RESULTS: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors caused  significant effective renal plasma flow changes in 55% of subjects with diffuse  renal parenchymal disease and in 75% of subjects with essential hypertension. The  effective renal plasma flow changes were more significant in subjects with  preserved renal function (normal baseline effective renal plasma flow) compared  to subjects with reduced baseline effective renal plasma flow. CONCLUSION: The  application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with diffuse   renal parenchymal disease and in individuals with essential hypertension may  result in significant hemodynamic changes in the kidney, accompanied by changes  in effective renal plasma flow. The extent of the changes caused by angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors depends on the preexisting functional status of the   kidney."|"renal,effective,flow,plasma,changes"|"renal,effective,flow,plasma,subjects" 
"AB  - Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by the autonomous hypersecretion of  aldosterone, is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Patients with PA  have a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity than essential hypertension. The  two common subtypes of PA, aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and idiopathic  hyperaldosteronism (IHA), should be differentiated, because the former is an  indication for adrenalectomy, and the latter is treated by medication.  18-Hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, known as hybrid steroids, have been  recognized as markers for the differentiation of aldosterone-producing adenoma  and rare glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism from other subtypes of PA.   Hybrid steroids have been measured using immunoassays such as enzyme-linked  immunoassays; however, immunoassays for hybrid steroids are not widely used.  Recently, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for hybrid  steroids was developed. The ability to measure hybrid steroids using LC-MS/MS  will be useful for the differential diagnosis of subtypes of PA."|"pa,hybrid,steroids,aldosterone,subtypes"|"hybrid,pa,steroids,ms,aldosterone" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between C825T polymorphism of G protein  beta3 subunit (GNB3) gene and different Hilit types of essential hypertension  (EH) in the Uygur nationality of Xinjiang. METHODS: According to Uygur medical  theories, EH patients (as the EH group) and non-EH patients (as the control  group) were assigned to four Hilit groups. The C825T polymorphism of GNB3 was  detected in 161 EH patients and 379 non-EH subjects of different Hilit types by  using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  (PCR-RFLP) to explore the difference of the genotypes and allelic frequencies and  hypertension. RESULTS: (1) In Xinjiang Uygur population, the distribution  frequencies of GNB3 C825T polymorphism were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg  (chi2 = 0.871, P = 0.647). (2) There was no statistical difference in the  distribution frequencies of three genotypes and two alleles of GNB3 between the  EH group and the control group (P > 0.05). (3) There was statistical difference  in distribution frequencies of three genotypes between the abnormal Sapra and  non-abnormal Sapra group (the sum of abnormal Sewda, abnormal Kan, and abnormal  Balhem) (chi2 = 6.905, P = 0.032), especially between the abnormal Sapra and  abnormal Balhem groups (chi2 = 10.404, P = 0.006), but there was no statistical  difference in distribution frequencies of alleles between the two groups (P >  0.05). (4) In 161 EH patients, there was statistical difference in the  distribution frequencies of three genotypes and two alleles between the abnormal   Sapra and non-abnormal Sapra group (chi2 = 9.034, P = 0.011; chi2 = 4.701, P =  0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Both TT genotype and T allele of GNB3 C825T polymorphism  might not be associated with EH patients in Xinjiang Uygur populations. However,   they were correlated with hypertension patients of non-abnormal Sapra, indicating  the pathogeneses of EH with different Hilit types might be different."|"eh,polymorphism,gnb3,patients,c825t"|"abnormal,eh,frequencies,group,patients" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is one of the most prevalent and important public health  concerns in both westernized and developing countries. Recent studies have  demonstrated that successful long-term treatment of hypertension has a  significant impact on morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)  and stroke. Chinese classical formulas, which are important components of  traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been increasingly accepted by patients  with CVDs worldwide. According to TCM theory and syndrome differentiation,  hypertension could be categorized into 3 patterns including fire syndrome, fluid   retention syndrome, and deficiency syndrome. Chinese classical formulas,  including Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli tang, Tianma Gouteng yin, Zhen Gan Xifeng tang,   Banxia Baizhu Tianma tang, Liu Wei Dihuang wan, etc, play an important role in  the treatment of essential hypertension, which could be further research  priorities."|"hypertension,important,tang,syndrome,chinese"|"hypertension,syndrome,chinese,important,tang" 
"AB  - In the present study, the correlation of polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein E  (apoE) gene with the susceptibility of essential hypertension (EH) was  investigated. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the apoE gene at the -491 A>T,  +969 C>G, and +2836 G>A sites were determined in 221 non-EH individuals and 109  subjects with EH of Chinese Hui ethnicity using polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The results showed  that neither the genotypic frequency nor the allelic frequency at the -491 A>T  and +969 C>G sites exhibited a statistically significant difference between these  two groups (P > 0.05). However, a significant difference was observed in  genotypic frequency and allelic frequency at the +2836 G>A site between EH  patients and non-EH individuals (P < 0.01). In addition, a significantly higher  frequency of the A allele at the +2836 G>A site was also detected in EH patients   (83%) compared with controls (47.5%) (P < 0.01; OR = 4.82, 95%CI = 3.25-7.17); in  contrast, the frequency of the G allele at the +2836 G>A site was significantly  lower (17%) in the patient group in comparison with the non-EH cohorts (52.5%) (P  < 0.01; OR = 0.21, 95%CI = 0.14-0.31). These results suggest that the  polymorphism at the +2836 G>A site in the apoE gene is strongly correlated with  the susceptibility to EH in the Chinese Hui ethnic population."|"eh,frequency,site,apoe,gene"|"eh,frequency,2836,site,01" 
"AB  - To investigate the association of eNOS gene polymorphism with essential  hypertension in the Chinese Han population, we examined polymorphisms of the  rs2070744 (T-->C), rs1800780 (A-->G), and rs3918181 (A-->G) loci. The results  demonstrated that the genotypic frequency at the rs1800780 (A-->G) locus was  significantly different between patients with essential hypertension and the  control cohorts (P < 0.05); while genotypic frequencies and allelic frequencies  at rs2070744 (T-->C) and rs3918181 (A-->G) loci had no statistical difference  between the patient group and controls (P > 0.05). In addition, haplotype  analysis found a statistically significant difference for haplotype TGA, with OR   (95% CI) of 1.549 (1.116-2.150) (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that  polymorphism of rs1800780 (A-->G) in the eNOS gene may be one of the most  important genetic factors associated with essential hypertension susceptibility,   and those who have haplotype TGA may be at risk to develop essential  hypertension."|"essential,hypertension,rs1800780,haplotype,difference"|"essential,hypertension,05,haplotype,rs1800780" 
"AB  - The objective of this review was to assess the current clinical evidence of  moxibustion for essential hypertension (EH). 7 electronic databases were searched  until March 2013. Randomized clinical trials testing moxibustion, or combined  with antihypertensive drugs, against antihypertensive drugs alone were included.   Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were  conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Finally, 5 randomized trials were   included. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated as  generally low. As compared to antihypertensive drugs, no positive results in BP  (RR: 1.19 [0.50, 2.81]; P=0.70), was found about moxibustion. However, when  combined with antihypertensive drugs, positive results in SBP (WMD: -9.57  [-10.80, -8.34]; P<0.00001), DBP (WMD: -4.08 [-4.60, -3.56]; P<0.00001), and BP  (RR: 3.35 [1.03, 10.89]; P=0.04) were found about moxibustion plus  antihypertensive drugs. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the  safety of moxibustion is still uncertain. Therefore, no confirm conclusion about   the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion as adjunctive treatment for EH could   be made. Rigorously designed trials are needed to confirm the evidence."|"moxibustion,trials,drugs,antihypertensive,included"|"moxibustion,antihypertensive,drugs,trials,included" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The association between alpha-adducin gene G614T  polymorphism and essential hypertension (EH) is not clear. The present study was   carried out to examine a possible association between alpha-adducin gene G614T  mutation and essential hypertension in Chinese population. METHODS: A total of  170 patients with essential hypertension (EH group) and 154 normotensive subjects  (Control group) were genotyped for the cytoskeletal protein single nucleotide  polymorphism G614T of the alpha-adducin gene by PCR-RFLP technique. Systolic  blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), low   density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), left atrial diameter (LA DIA), left ventricular  diameter (LV DIA) and other parameters were recorded in EH group. RESULTS: There   was significant association between EH and alpha-adducin genotypes (P<0.05). GT  and TT genotypes in EH group had higher LDL levels as compared to GG carriers  (P<0.05). The LDL concentration was significantly elevated in patients with GT  and TT genotypes. The LDL levels also differed significantly in male patients  with all the three genotypes. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A significant  association was found between ADD1 gene G614T polymorphism and EH in Chinese  patients.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity has beneficial effects on arterial stiffness among   healthy adults. There is a lack of data on this relationship in adults with  hypertension. The majority of studies which have examined physical activity and  arterial stiffness have used subjective measures of activity. The aim of this  study was to investigate the relationship between objectively measured habitual  physical activity and arterial stiffness in individuals with newly diagnosed  essential hypertension. METHODS: Adults attending an outpatient hypertension  clinic were recruited into this cross sectional study. Physical activity was  measured using a triaxial accelerometer. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and  augmentation index (AIx) were measured using applanation tonometry. Participant's  full lipid profile and glucose were determined through the collection of a  fasting blood sample. RESULTS: Fifty-three adults [51(14) years, 26 male]  participated, 16 of whom had the metabolic syndrome. Inactivity was positively  correlated with PWV (r = .53, P < .001) and AIx (r = .48, P < .001). There were  significant inverse associations between habitual physical activity of all  intensities and both AIx and PWV. In stepwise regression, after adjusting for  potential confounders, physical activity was a significant predictor of AIx and  PWV. CONCLUSION: Habitual physical activity of all intensities is associated with  reduced arterial stiffness among adults with hypertension."|"activity,physical,adults,hypertension,arterial"|"activity,physical,adults,aix,arterial" 
"AB  - AIM: To determine the significance of obesity as a risk factor in high school  population with hypertension. METHODS: Testing was conducted during the school  year 2006-2007 on a sample of 1121 students, 15-18 years of age (306 boys and 815  girls) from three high schools in Zenica (Grammar School, Teacher Training High  School and Secondary School for Nurses). Increased relative risk factor with  reliability coefficient that points to the significance of the correlation of  risk factors and development of a disease was examined using analytical  epidemiological research methods and statistical analysis (the linear correlation  coefficient, chi2 test, and the relative risk ) . RESULTS: Obesity, e.g. Body  Mass Index (BMI) more than 95 was found in 15 (5%) boys and 57 (7%) girls.  Increased relative risk of developing essential arterial hypertension was found  in obese boys (RR= 9.00 ) and girls (RR= 2.66) with the coefficient of  reliability which pointed to the significance of the relationship between obesity  and arterial hypertension morbidity. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a significant risk  factor for the occurrence of essential arterial hypertension in boys and girls.  Monitoring the nutritional status of youth, regular systematic medical  examinations with measuring tension and implementing measures to control  nutrition, are important preventive public health tasks."|"risk,hypertension,school,obesity,girls"|"risk,school,boys,girls,hypertension" 
"AB  - AIM: The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; also known as NR3C2) plays important  roles in the modulation of blood pressure. The effect of NR3C2 polymorphisms on  antihypertensive response to enalapril was investigated. PATIENTS & METHODS: Two   hundred and seventy nine essential hypertension patients treated with enalapril  were genotyped for two NR3C2 tagSNPs, rs5522 and rs2070950, by Sequenom MassArray  technology. RESULTS: The reductions in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were  significantly greater in AA homozygotes compared with AG+GG genotype carriers for  the rs5522 polymorphism (p = 0.009), and the reductions in DBP were greater in GG  homozygotes compared with GC+CC genotype carriers for the rs2070950 polymorphism,  with marginal significance (p = 0.065). Stepwise multiple regression analysis  indicated that significant predictors of DBP reduction were baseline DBP (p <  0.001), waist:hip ratio (p = 0.001) and rs5522 genotype (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION:   NR3C2 rs5522 affects blood pressure response to enalapril treatment and may serve  as a useful pharmacogenomic marker of antihypertensive response to enalapril in  essential hypertension patients."|"nr3c2,dbp,rs5522,enalapril,pressure"|"dbp,enalapril,nr3c2,rs5522,blood" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of polymorphisms of G protein-coupled  inwardly-rectifying potassium channels 4 (GIRK4) gene with essential hypertension  in ethnic Uygurs from southern Xinjiang. METHODS: A total of 1194 (461 males and   733 females) Uygur residents aged 30 to 70 and with a body mass index (BMI) over   18.5 kg/m(2) were selected from Hetian region. All of the subjects have received   questionnaire survey, physical examination, biochemical analysis and blood  pressure measurement. They were divided into hypertensive group and normotensive   group. Genotyping by the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction method was performed  for 4 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs4937391, rs2604204, rs6590357 and  rs1122149), and a case-control study was carried out. RESULTS: Genotype  distributions of rs4937391, rs2604204, rs6590357 and rs1122149 in both groups  were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P> 0.05). The average systolic blood pressure  of CC genotype of rs11221497 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)[(132.69+/-  26.9) mmHg)] was higher than the CG genotype [(127.4+/- 22.7) mmHg] and GG  genotype [(121.1+/- 26.3) mmHg]. There has a significantly difference in average   systolic and diastolic blood pressures between CC and GG genotypes (P< 0.05). A  case-control association analysis revealed that the rs11221497 SNP was in  association with essential hypertension with the dominant model [P< 0.05, OR=  0.67 (0.49-0.93)]. Haplotype analysis indicated that H6(C-G-C-G) was  significantly more common in normotensive group than hypertensive group (P=  0.001).

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction, which is characterized by an imbalance  between relaxing and contracting factors, procoagulant and anticoagulant  substances, and between pro-inflammatory mediators, may play a particularly  significant role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Numerous experimental  and clinical reports suggest that a high von Willebrand factor (vWF) level  reflects endothelial damage or dysfunction. Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is a  condition characterized by a spectrum of retinal vascular signs in people with  elevated blood pressure. The pathophysiological mechanism of HR is not completely  understood. Elevated blood pressure alone does not fully account for the extent  of retinopathy. Endothelial dysfunction and mechanisms known to be involved in  vascular lesions may be involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of HR.  Therefore, this study was designed to answer the following questions: (i) Do vWf   levels change in HR? and (ii) Is there any relation between degree of HR and vWf   levels? MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 80 hypertensive patients with  HR. Group 1 comprised 40 patients with grade I HR, and group 2 comprised 40  patients with grade II HR. We selected 40 healthy subjects for the control group.  RESULTS: Level of vWf in group 2 was significantly higher than in group 1  (p=0.017) and the control group (p<0.001), and it was also higher in group 1 than  in the control group (p<0.005). Also, vWf showed positive correlation with degree  of HR in the hypertensive group (r=0.284, p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our study  suggests that endothelial dysfunction, which is a mechanism known to be involved   in vascular lesions, may promote the development of HR."|"hr,vwf,group,endothelial,dysfunction"|"hr,group,vwf,dysfunction,endothelial" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of magnesium  administered before induction on the hemodynamic response and QT dispersion (QTd)  related with intubation in hypertensive patients and to compare it with  lidocaine. METHODS: Patients with essential hypertension who were under </= 65  years old, scheduled for elective surgery with a Mallampati score of I-II were  included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups; group M   (n = 20) received magnesium sulfate, group L was prescribed lidocaine, and group   C (control group) received saline. Standard 12-lead ECG readings were taken  before the induction of anesthesia and at the first and fifth minutes following  intubation. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between   the groups in terms of age, sex and demographic characteristics. There was no  significant difference in the QT interval values before induction and 5 minutes  after intubation in all groups. In group M, QTd values were significantly lower  at the first and fifth minutes than before induction. There were no statistically  significant differences in QTd values at different times in group L and group C.   CONCLUSION: QTd is not increased during tracheal intubation in hypertensive  patients so there is no need for magnesium sulfate for these patients. But as QTd  has been shown to increase during tracheal intubation for coronary artery disease  patients, magnesium sulfate might be useful for those patients although future  studies are required to confirm this statement."|"patients,intubation,qtd,induction,magnesium"|"group,patients,intubation,qtd,induction" 
"AB  - We report the case of a 75-year old woman who presented with shortness of breath   and haemoptysis. She had been treated for presumed essential hypertension for  many years. On admission she was found to be severely hypertensive. Chest X-ray  showed pulmonary oedema. However, an echocardiogram reported good systolic  ventricular function. Her hypertension and pulmonary oedema did not respond to  medical treatment necessitating intubation. A CT angiogram identified the  cause--undiagnosed bilateral severe.

"AB  - The paper considers modern conceptions about the prognostic value of left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) different types. The role of interaction of  demographic, hemodynamic, regulatory, intracardiac factors in the formation of  prognostic peculiarities in patients with different types of LVH is marked. The  data of own investigations indicating that the left ventricular myocardial mass  has not less important value in long-term general prognostication than belonging   to a concentric or eccentric LVH type in elderly patients with hypertension are  presented. Some data concerning left atrial dilatation as an inalienable  component of the cardiovascular continuum in essential hypertension are  submitted. Pathogenic and prognostic contribution of metabolic disorders  associated with hypertension and abdominal obesity in the development of the  heart's left parts structural and functional disorders is shown. Issues of  long-term outcome in elderly hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome taking  into account the peculiarities of left ventricular geometry are highlighted."|"left,prognostic,hypertension,patients,ventricular"|"left,hypertension,lvh,patients,prognostic" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: The term hypertensive nephrosclerosis has traditionally been used  to describe a clinical syndrome characterized by long-term essential  hypertension, hypertensive retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal  proteinuria, and progressive renal insufficiency. In the absence of renal biopsy,  the diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis is one of exclusion. METHODS: We  retrospectively studied 735 patients who had renal biopsies at Ain Shams  University Hospitals between January 2008 and Dec 2010. The prevalence of  vascular hypertensive changes was studied in relation to clinical presentation  and the glomerular pathology pattern. RESULTS: Male to female ratio was 1:1 and  the mean age was 27+/-17 years. No vascular hypertensive changes were found in  44.5% of biopsies while mild, moderate and severe changes were found in 28%, 22%   and 4.2% respectively. Malignant hypertensive changes were seen in 1.2% of  biopsies. Lupus nephritis was the most common etiology representing 18.9% of all   cases, followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (13.5%),  membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (13.3%) and membranous  glomerulonephritis (8.2%). Moderate to severe vascular hypertensive changes were   more common in biopsies with FSGS compared to other glomerulopathies.  Hypertensive nephrosclerosis as the sole cause of renal failure represented only   1.6% of cases. Significant associations were found between the degree of vascular  hypertensive changes and the grade of hypertension. Patients with severe vascular  hypertensive changes were significantly older and had significantly higher serum   creatinine levels compared to other groups. CONCLUSION: History and grade of  hypertension significantly influence the degree of vascular hypertensive changes   in renal biopsy. Moderate to severe vascular hypertensive changes were more  common in biopsies with FSGS compared to other pathologies.

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop the missing link between hyperuricemia and hypertension.  METHODS: The study was conducted in Department of Biochemistry in collaboration  with Nephrology Unit of Internal Medicine Department. Hypertension was defined  according to blood pressure readings by definitions of the Seventh Report of the   Joint National Committee. Totally 205 newly diagnosed and untreated essential  hypertensive cases and age-sex matched normotensive controls were enrolled in the  study. The potential confounding factors of hyperuricemia and hypertension in  both cases and controls were controlled. Uric acid levels in all participants  were analyzed. RESULTS: Renal function between newly diagnosed hypertensive cases  and normotensive healthy controls were adjusted. The mean serum uric acid  observed in newly diagnosed hypertensive cases and in normotensive healthy  controls were (290.05+/-87.05) mumol/L and (245.24+/-99.38) mumol/L respectively.  A total of 59 (28.8%) participants of cases and 28 (13.7%) participants of  controls had hyperuricemia (odds ratio 2.555 (95% CI: 1.549-4.213), P<0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: The mean serum uric acid levels and number of hyperuricemic subjects  were found to be significantly higher in cases when compared to controls."|"cases,controls,hypertension,hyperuricemia,acid"|"cases,controls,acid,diagnosed,hypertension" 
"AB  - Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) polymorphisms have been studied as candidate risk   factors for hypertension with inconsistent results, possibly due to heterogeneity  among various genetic and environmental factors. A case-control association study  was conducted to investigate a possible involvement of polymorphisms of three RAS  genes: AGT M235T (rs699), ACE I/D (rs4340) and G2350A (rs4343), and AGTR1 A1166C   (rs5186) in essential hypertensive patients. A total of 211 cases and 211  controls were recruited for this study. Genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP  method. The genotype and allele distribution of the M235T variant differed  significantly in hypertensives and normotensives (OR-CI = 2.62 (1.24-5.76), P =  0.006; OR-CI = 0.699 (0.518-0.943), P = 0.018), respectively. When the samples  were segregated based on sex, the 235TT genotype and T allele were predominant in  the female patients (OR-CI = 5.68 (1.60-25.10), P = 0.002; OR-CI = 0.522  (0.330-0.826), P = 0.005) as compare to the male patients (OR-CI = 1.54  (1.24-5.76), P = 0.34; OR-CI = 0.874 (0.330-0.826), P = 0.506), respectively. For  ACE DD variant, we found overrepresentation of "I"-allele (homozygous II and  heterozygous ID) in unaffected males which suggest its protective role in studied  population (OR-CI = 0.401 (0.224-0.718); P = 0.0009). The M235T variant of the  AGT is significantly associated with female hypertensives and ACE DD variant  could be a risk allele for essential hypertension in south India."|"allele,variant,ace,factors,polymorphisms"|"ci,allele,variant,ace,m235t" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) has  been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling under different  pathologic conditions. The role of genetic polymorphisms in the LOX1 gene,  however, remains unclear in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)  for patients with hypertension. METHODS: A total of 536 patients diagnosed with  essential hypertension (EH) were recruited in this study. Patients were assigned   to the LVH+ (n=143) and LVH- (n=393) groups, respectively. The serum LOX1 level  was measured and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e. intron 4  (G-->A), intron 5(T-->G), and 3' UTR (T-->C) of the LOX1 gene were genotyped.  RESULTS: The genotype frequencies of intron 4 G>A and 3'UTR T>C were not  significantly different between the LVH+ and LVH- groups (both P>0.05), however,   frequencies of 501G>C were significantly different between those two groups  (P=0.007). The 501CC genotype carriers had a markedly higher serum LOX1 level and  an increased risk to develop LVH (adjusted OR=2.444, adjusted P=0.002). There was  a positive correlation between serum LOX1 level and left ventricular mass index  (r=0.907, P<0.001); a cutoff value of 1.0 ng/mL for sLOX-1 was applied to  significantly differentiate the LVH+ patients from the LVH- patients with 84%  sensitivity and 86% specificity. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that both the 501>C  SNP in the LOX1 gene and the serum LOX1 level may be used to predict the  development of LVH among EH patients."|"lox1,lvh,level,patients,serum"|"lvh,lox1,patients,level,serum" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Combined treatment of a calcium antagonist and  alpha/beta-adrenoreceptor blocker is expected to offer some advantages in the  management of hypertension; however, their antihypertensive efficacy and safety  remain relatively under-explored. METHODS: The current study addresses the 24-h  antihypertensive efficacy and safety of arotinolol combined with a different  calcium channel blocker. One-hundred fifty-two patients were randomly divided  into three groups: nifedipine, amlodipine and felodipine group. In each group,  the antihypertensive treatment dose was 30 mg/d, 5 mg/d, 5 mg/d long acting  nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine plus 20 mg/d arotinolol, respectively. Blood  pressure was measured in ABPM devices and mercury manometer. RESULTS: The result   showed that the effective rate of one year antihypertensive treatment of  arotinolol combined with nifedipine was 51 of 53, significantly effective (p <  0.05) among three combinations. It also showed that there was no statistical  significant difference (p > 0.05) in controlled rate of morning peak blood  pressure between treatment of arotinolol combined with amlodipine and arotinolol   combined with nifedipine, but there was a significant difference (p < 0.01) in  controlled rate of morning peak blood pressure between arotinolol combined with  nifedipine vs. felodipine and arotinolol combined with amlodipine vs. felodipine.  CONCLUSIONS: The therapy approached of arotinolol combined with nifedipine or  amlodipine could be effective and well-tolerated, and they can be used as the  better chosen antihypertensive drug."|"combined,arotinolol,nifedipine,antihypertensive,amlodipine"|"arotinolol,combined,nifedipine,amlodipine,antihypertensive" 
"AB  - Lipocalin families including lipocalin-2 and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein  (A-FABP) were recently identified as novel adipokines to be associated with the  cardiovascular risk variables of the metabolic syndrome. We evaluated the  lipocalin-2 and A-FABP levels in 62 patients with essential hypertension (EHT)  and 16 age-, gender- and body mass index-matched normotensive healthy subjects  (NT). Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between lipocalin-2, A-FABP  levels, inflammatory markers including hsCRP and IL-10, and flow-mediated  vasodilatation (FMD). In EHT, circulating lipocalin-2 levels were significantly  higher than in NT (85.0 +/- 37.6 ng/ml versus 43.8 +/- 13.1 ng/ml, p < 0.001).  However, A-FABP levels were not different between patients with EHT and NT. Serum  lipocalin-2 levels were positively associated with SBP (r = 0.54, p < 0.001), DBP  (r = 0.34, p = 0.003) and fasting glucose levels (r = 0.25, p = 0.032), On the  other hand, circulating A-FABP levels were significantly associated with  variables such as BMI, fasting insulin, insulin resistance index and hsCRP.  Multiple linear regression analysis showed that mean arterial pressure was  associated with fasting glucose, lipocalin-2 levels, age, BMI and hsCRP levels  (R(2)= 0.456). However, circulating lipocalin-2 levels were not associated with  FMD. In conclusion, lipocalin-2 levels were significantly higher in patients with  EHT, and were independently associated with mean arterial pressure."|"lipocalin,associated,levels,fabp,eht"|"levels,lipocalin,associated,fabp,eht" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: Abstract Introduction: AGT gene harbors several variants of which 21   are found to be in high linkage disequilibrium as per Hapmap database. Studies  delineating the importance of these tagged SNPs are very limited and lacking from  Indian population. In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of four  tagged SNPs namely, g.6635G > A, g.6506G > A, g.12840G > A, and g.13828T > C at  AGT locus along with the analyses of haplotype and epistatic interactions in  causing susceptibility to essential hypertension (EHT). METHODS: About 215  hypertensives and 230 normotensives were genotyped for selected tagged SNPs using  PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Significant association was obtained for g.6635G > A  and g.6506G > A polymorphisms wherein GG homozygotes for both the markers were at  risk for developing the condition. g.13828T > C polymorphism specially, female  heterozygotes (TC) were found to be at increased risk for EHT. Haplotype GGGC was  found to have a significant protective effect (p = 0.0059). Markers g.6506G > A  and g.12840G > A resulted in the creation of new enhancer sites thereby affecting  splicing process. CONCLUSION: The present report is the first one in the  literature showing general- and gender-specific association of g.6506G > A and  g.13828T > C polymorphisms, respectively, with EHT. However, further studies for   replication of present observations are warranted from other populations and  other parts of India."|"g,present,snps,found,tagged"|"6506g,13828t,eht,present,snps" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: An electronic system for salt intake assessment using a 24-h dietary   recall method has been developed in Japan. We evaluated the validity of this salt  intake system for assessing salt intake. METHODS: We prospectively obtained data   on estimated salt intake using 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (24-hUNaCl) and  salt intake by the salt intake assessment system from 203 consecutive outpatients  with essential hypertension (age: 67.8 +/- 10.7 years; 53.7% men). RESULTS: Mean   values were 9.7 +/- 2.9 g/day for 24-hUNaCl and 9.1 +/- 2.9 g/day for the salt  intake assessment system before corrections. The salt intake estimated by the  present system was significantly correlated with 24-hUNaCl (r = 0.66, p <  0.0001). After corrections for habitual use of discretionary seasonings, habitual  intake of salty foods, and physical activity, correlation coefficients between  salt intake and 24-hUNaCl increased from 0.60 to 0.66 in men <65 years, from 0.80  to 0.81 in men >/= 65 years, from 0.64 to 0.75 in women <65 years, and from 0.52   to 0.59 in women >/= 65 years. After further correction for regional differences   in average salt intake, the correlation coefficient reached 0.72 in all patients.  CONCLUSION: After correction for dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and  differences in average salt intake by region, this system may be a useful tool in  Japan to encourage salt restriction in the clinical treatment of hypertension and  improve public health in terms of salt restriction overall."|"salt,intake,system,hunacl,dietary"|"salt,intake,24,years,65" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: To examine effects of a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB)  azelnidipine on uric acid metabolism in hypertensive patients. METHODS:  Azelnidipine was administered to 72 patients at a daily dose of 8 mg or 16 mg. In  22 cases out of the 72 patients, a different CCB was switched to azelnidipine.  Blood pressure was measured and biochemical parameters of blood and urine were  evaluated before and 2-3 months after the administration. RESULTS: Azelnidipine  significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the heart   rate. It decreased both serum urate levels and the urinary uric acid to  creatinine ratio (Uur/Ucr), but did not affect the uric acid clearance to  creatinine clearance ratio (Cur/Ccr). Azelnidipine decreased both Uur/Ucr and  Cur/Ccr in patients with Uur/Ucr >/= 0.5 or >/= 0.34, although it did not change   these clearance parameters in patients with Uur/Ucr <0.5 or <0.34. Azelnidipine  decreased the serum urate levels and Uur/Ucr in hyperuricemic patients with uric   acid levels >/= 7.0 mg/dL in males and >/= 6.0 mg/dL in females. It did not  change these parameters in normouricemic patients with serum urate levels <7.0  mg/dL in males and <6.0 mg/dL in females. Azelnidipine decreased Uur/Ucr and  Cur/Ccr in hyperuricemic patients with normal or over excretion of uric acid,  although it did not change these clearance parameters in hyperuricemic patients  with uric acid hypoexcretion. CONCLUSIONS: Azelnidipine decreased the serum urate  acid levels and Uur/Ucr, and this response was most prominent in hyperuricemic  patients or patients with normal and over excretion of uric acid."|"azelnidipine,patients,acid,uric,decreased"|"patients,acid,azelnidipine,ucr,uric" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study documented the prevalence and clinical features of white  coat hypertension (WCH) among Chinese Han patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus   (T2DM). METHODS: Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements were  compared in 856 patients with T2DM to determine the frequency of WCH (WCH was  defined as clinical blood pressure >/=140/90 mmHg and daytime blood pressure  <135/85 mmHg and/or 24-h ambulatory BP (ABP) mean value of <130/80 mmHg on  ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass  index (BMI), waist to height ratio (WHtR), fasting blood glucose, glycosylated  hemoglobin level and circadian BP patterns were also measured to find clinical  features predictive of WCH in T2DM. RESULTS: The prevalence of WCH was 7.36%  (63/856) in the overall population, 6.13% (29/473) in male and 8.88% (34/383) in   female (p < 0.05). WCH accounted for 14.03% (63/449) of diagnosed hypertension.  Age, course of T2DM, male WC were independent protective factors, whereas female   sex, smoking and alcohol consumption were independent risk factors for WCH in  T2DM. Non-dippers and reverse dippers made up larger proportion of the WCH group   (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: WCH is relatively common among T2DM patients, it is a  unique condition distinct from essential hypertension (EH), and WCH patients also  exhibit significant differences in clinical parameters."|"wch,t2dm,patients,clinical,bp"|"wch,t2dm,blood,bp,clinical" 
"AB  - Genetic variation of NEDD4L has been associated with hypertension and related  phenotypes with conflicting results, probably attributable to gender-, age- and  ethnicity-related variations in its phenotypic expression. We evaluated the  association of three representative polymorphisms in NEDD4L (rs2288774, rs3865418  and rs4149601) with essential hypertension (EH) in a community-based sample of  men (n = 1029) and women (n = 869) belonging to Han Chinese, Southern China, to  probe whether gender interacts with NEDD4L in contributing to the risk of EH. In   this population sample, rs4149601 was excluded from further analysis due to  deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For two other variants tested, the  allele frequencies and genotype distributions did not differ between cases and  controls (p > 0.05) when both genders were combined. However, sex-stratified  analysis revealed that the distribution of the dominant model of rs2288774 (TC +   CC versus TT) and the additive and dominant (CT + TT versus CC) models of  rs3865418 differed significantly between cases and controls in men (p = 0.044,  0.041 and 0.016, respectively) but not in women. After adjusting for confounding   factors, logistic regression analysis showed that rs2288774 and rs3865418 (in the  dominant model) were still significantly associated with EH (rs2288774: OR =  0.73, 95% CI = 0.57-0.95, p = 0.017 and rs3865418: OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55-0.92,  p = 0.009) in men. There was a significant interaction between the NEDD4L  genotype and gender (p for interaction: 0.046 for rs2288774 and 0.033 for  rs3865418). Genetic variation in NEDD4L may have sex-dependent effects in the  development of EH in Han Chinese. Previous studies that ignore gender-specific  effects in their design and interpretation could have failed to identify a  uniform conclusion."|"rs2288774,nedd4l,gender,rs3865418,eh"|"nedd4l,rs2288774,rs3865418,eh,gender" 
"AB  - There is no agreement on the involvement of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)  gene A(1166)C variant and essential hypertension. The purpose of this study was  to investigate the association between angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene  A(1166)C variants with essential hypertension and some related parameters in a  sample of Jordanian hypertensive patients. DNA samples from 108 hypertensive  individuals and 102 age- and gender-matched non-hypertensive controls of the  Jordanian population were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction followed by  restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP) methods to determine  the frequency of A(1166)C variants alleles. No statistically significant  differences were found in the distribution of alleles and genotypes between  hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals, not even after gender segregation.  The frequency of the variant allele (C(1166)) was significantly higher in the  early-onset compared to the late-onset group of hypertensive males, in subjects  with positive family history of hypertension, and in subjects with high waist  circumference. In conclusion, the A(1166)C polymorphism is not associated with  essential hypertension in Jordanian hypertensive individuals. However, it was  associated with an early onset of hypertension in males, with positive family  history of hypertension, and with high waist circumference irrespective of blood   pressure status."|"hypertensive,hypertension,jordanian,individuals,essential"|"hypertensive,hypertension,1166,essential,individuals" 
"AB  - N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicts cardiovascular  events and mortality in hypertensive patients. Relationship between NT-proBNP  level and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is well known in hypertensive  patients. However, the studies investigating relationship between LV geometric  patterns and serum NT-proBNP level have conflicting results and are in a limited   number. The goal of the present study is to investigate relation between  NT-proBNP and abnormal LV geometric patterns in untreated hypertensive patients.   Measurements were obtained from 273 patients with untreated essential  hypertension (mean age = 51.7 +/- 5.8 years) and 44 healthy control subjects  (mean age; 51.3 +/- 4.7). Four different geometric patterns (NG: normal geometry;  CR: concentric remodelling; EH: eccentric hypertrophy; CH: concentric  hypertrophy) were determined according to LV mass index (LVMI) and relative wall   thickness. NT-proBNP and other biochemical markers were measured in all subjects.  The highest NT-proBNP levels were determined in the CH group compared with the  control group and other geometric patterns (p < 0.05). NT-proBNP levels of all  geometric patterns were higher than the control group (p < 0.05, for all).  NT-proBNP levels were similar between CR and NG groups (p > 0.05). NT-proBNP was   independently associated with LV geometry (beta = 0.304, p = 0.003) and LVMI  (beta = 0.266, p = 0.007) in multiple linear regression analysis. Serum NT-proBNP  level was independently associated with LVMI and LV geometry in untreated  hypertensive patients with preserved ejection fraction."|"nt,probnp,lv,patients,hypertensive"|"nt,probnp,lv,geometric,patients" 
"AB  - Abstract Oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of  essential hypertension and is associated with changes in the cell membrane fatty   acid composition and fluidity. As (Na,K)-ATPase is modulated by the surrounding  lipid microenvironment, lipid peroxidation could alter the interactions of this  enzyme with the membrane components. Thus, modifications in the membrane fatty  acid profile will translate into effects on (Na,K)-ATPase activity. Accordingly,   a decrease in this enzyme activity has been reported in hypertensive patients.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between membrane fluidity   and fatty acid composition and (Na,K)-ATPase activity in erythrocytes of  essential hypertensive patients supplemented with antioxidant vitamins C and E. A  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 120 men with   essential hypertension assigned to receive vitamin C (1 g/day) +E (400 IU/day) or  placebo for 8 weeks. Measurements included OS related parameters: GSH/GSSG ratio,  F2-isoprostanes and antioxidant capacity of plasma, (Na,K)-ATPase activity and  erythrocytes membrane fatty acid composition (PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids;   SAFA, saturated fatty acids). Associations were assessed by Pearson correlation  and the differences by Student t-test (p<0.05). Supplemented hypertensive  patients showed higher activity of (Na,K)-ATPase and proportion of PUFA, and  lower blood pressure, OS markers and proportion of SAFA, versus placebo. The  activity of (Na,K)-ATPase correlated negatively with the proportion of SAFA, but   positively with that of PUFA in both groups. Supplementation with vitamins C+E  resulted in decreased OS and increased fluidity and PUFA proportion in the  membrane, both of which positively modulate (Na,K)-ATPase activity, accounting  for the blood pressure reduction."|"atpase,na,activity,os,membrane"|"activity,atpase,na,fatty,membrane" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between anxiety disorders and left  ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: Left  ventricular structure and function were assessed with echocardiography in 56  patients with essential hypertension and anxiety disorder (study group) and in 56  patients with hypertension only (control group). Serum adrenomedullin levels were  also measured in these patients. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant   difference in the left ventricular ejection fraction between the study and the  control group (54.21 +/- 88.81% versus 56.01 +/- 7.85%, p>0.05). The left  ventricular mass index (LVMI) in study group was higher than in control group  (137.05 +/- 9.42 versus 123.57 +/- 7.01 g/m(2), p=0.001). The plasma levels of  adrenomedullin in study group was higher than in control group (25.97 +/- 5.48  versus 18.32 +/- 6.97 ng/L, p=0.001). Levels of plasma adrenomedullin were  positively correlated with LVMI in the study (r=0.734, p<0.05) and control group   (r=0.592, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Anxiety disorders are associated with elevated  plasma adrenomedullin levels and increased left ventricular hypertrophy in  patients with essential hypertension. The clinical significance of these changes   requires further investigation."|"left,ventricular,patients,adrenomedullin,group"|"group,control,left,patients,study" 
"AB  - Stroke is one of the most-frequent causes of death and the first cause of  disability worldwide. Different mechanisms are related to the pathogenesis of  stroke, involving multiple biological systems, which are often inter-connected.  Besides age, hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke and may  also predispose to the development of more subtle cerebral damage based on  arteriolar narrowing or pathological microvascular changes. Age and high blood  pressure are responsible for silent structural and functional cerebral changes  leading to white matter lesions and cognitive impairment. The clinical  significance and pathological substrate of white matter lesions are not fully  understood. Hypertensive patients have more white matter lesions, which are an  important prognostic factor for the development of stroke, cognitive impairment,   dementia and death, than normotensive people. Over the past 10 years, strong  evidence has emerged that cerebral white matter lesions in hypertensive patients   should be considered a silent early marker of brain damage. The mechanisms that  would explain all these relationships remain to be elucidated, but available data  suggest that arteriosclerosis of the penetrating brain vessels is the main factor  in the pathogenesis of ischemic white matter lesions."|"stroke,white,lesions,cerebral,matter"|"lesions,matter,white,stroke,cerebral" 
"AB  - Although recent studies have underscored the role of the heme-oxygenase (HO)  inducer hemin, on insulin-signaling and glucose metabolism, the underlying  mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, two-dimensional-gel  electrophoresis, massspectrometry and MSACOT-analyses were used to identify and  characterize novel proteins modulated by hemin in spontaneoushypertensive rat  (SHR), a model of essential hypertension with insulin resistance/impaired glucose  metabolism. In addition, the effects of hemin on endothelin-1 (ET-1),  protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B), atrial-natriuretic-peptide (ANP) and  its surrogate-marker urinary cGMP, and inflammatory cytokines including  TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta were investigated. In hemin-treated SHR, several  proteins related to oxidative-stress and metabolism were modulated. Particularly,  hemin enhanced aldolase- B, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, purine-nucleoside  phosphorylase, adenosine-kinase, argininosuccinate synthetase and carbonic  anhydrase-3 all of which are enzymes involved in glucose/energy metabolism and pH  homeostasis. Similarly, hemin potentiated antioxidant pathways including,  NADP(+)-dependant isocitrate-dehydrogenase, catalase,  glutathione-S-transferase-Yb1 and hsp70, a pleiotropic agent that regulates  protein-folding, oxidative/pro-inflammatory events. Hemin also increased enzymes   implicated in cell-growth such as the nitrilase-protein-family, but reduced  betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, an enzyme associated with insulin  resistance and dysfunctional glucose metabolism. Furthermore, hemin increased ANP  and its surrogate marker, urinary cGMP, but reduced ET-1, PTP-1B, TNF-alpha,  IL-6, IL-1beta, whereas the HO-inhibitor, chromium-mesoporphyrin abolished the  effects. The potentiation of ANP, urinary-cGMP, aldolade-B, fumarylacetoacetate  hydrolase, purine-nucleoside phosphorylase, adenosine-kinase, argininosuccinate  synthetase, carbonic anhydrase-3, hsp70 and the corresponding reduction of  betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, PTP-1B, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and  ET-1 may be responsible for the improved glucose metabolism in hemin-treated  animals. Collectively, these findings underscore the pleiotropic effects of the  HO-system in cellular homeostasis with important roles in metabolism and defence."|"hemin,metabolism,glucose,ho,protein"|"hemin,metabolism,il,glucose,1b" 
"AB  - The effects of genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1 C3435T, POR*28, CYP3A4*1G and  CYP3A5*3 variants and gender relating to metabolism on the exposure and response   of amlodipine in Chinese hypertensive patients were determined. Population  pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on data which were collected  prospectively from 60 Chinese patients with mild to moderate essential  hypertension [age range 40-74 years, males (n = 31), females (n = 29)] receiving   oral racemic amlodipine for 4 weeks. Blood pressure was evaluated at the end of  weeks 0 and 4. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes at the following  times: 0, 2, 6, and 24 h on about day 28 after administration of amlodipine. A  one-compartment model with first-order elimination and absorption best described   the amlodipine pharmacokinetic data. ABCB1 3435 genetic polymorphism and gender  affect the amlodipine oral clearance (CL/F). CL/F (L/h) = 28.8 x (1 +  GNDR)(-0.531) x (ABCB1 C3435T) where GNDR = 0 and 1 are for male and female,  respectively. The CL/F value in a male patient with the ABCB1 3435CC or CT  genotype is 28.8 L/h. Lower CL/F and higher exposure occurs in female subjects  with the ABCB1 3435CC or CT genotype who have greater decreases in blood pressure  after treatment with amlodipine. The results may help to improve the efficacy and  tolerability of amlodipine in essential hypertensive patients."|"amlodipine,abcb1,cl,blood,collected"|"amlodipine,abcb1,28,cl,blood" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Left ventricular (LV) synchronous contraction is impaired in patients  with hypertension (HT). The deleterious effects of HT on cardiovascular system  are more evident in patients with nondipper HT than dippers. In this study, we  aimed to investigate the effect of nondipping HT on LV systolic synchronicity  compared with dippers and controls. METHODS: One hundred patients with newly  diagnosed essential HT and 50 normotensive subjects were enrolled in this study.   The hypertensive patients were assigned 2 groups comprising 55 dippers and 45  nondippers. Each subject underwent a comprehensive transthoracic  echocardiographic examination. The evaluation of systolic dyssynchrony was  performed by tissue synchronization imaging, and the time to regional peak  systolic tissue velocity (Ts) in LV was measured on the basis of 12 segmental  models. The standard deviation (SD) of the 12 LV segments (Ts-SD-12) and maximal   difference in Ts between any two of the 12 LV segments (Ts-12) were calculated.  RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the synchronicity indexes were  significantly prolonged in the hypertensive patients. Furthermore, Ts-SD-12 and  Ts-12 values were found to be significantly impaired in patients with nondipper  HT, compared with dippers: Ts-SD-12 (38.1 +/- 18.7 vs. 31.8 +/- 15.4, P </=  0.001); Ts-12 (123.0 +/- 50.6 vs. 98.4 +/- 42.3, P </= 0.001). Stepwise  multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant negative  association between LV dyssynchrony indices and percentage decline in BP level  from day to night. CONCLUSION: Synchronous systolic contraction of LV is found to  be significantly impaired in patients with nondipping circadian pattern of HT  compared with dippers and the controls."|"lv,patients,ht,systolic,ts"|"12,ts,ht,lv,patients" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: Long-term therapy of hypertension may influence mineral status in  patients. However, drug-micronutrient interactions are largely unexplored in  practice. This study intended to evaluate the effect of hypotensive monotherapy  on iron, zinc, and copper levels, as well as on selected biochemical parameters,   in newly diagnosed patients with hypertension, and to assess the influence of  diet with optimal mineral levels on the mineral balance in these subjects.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients, aged 18-65 years with diagnosed  essential hypertension, beginning monotherapy treatment with diuretics, calcium  antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers, were  employed. Over three months, the patients underwent monotherapy (stage II). Next,  patients were randomly divided into a diet group (of 27 subjects) and a control  group (of 18 subjects). In this stage, which lasted one month, patients were  given the same drug but also followed an optimal mineral-content diet (for the  diet group), or else continued drug use without any change in diet (for control  group) (stage III). Lipids, glucose, ceruloplasmin, and ferritin--along with  superoxide dismutase and catalase activities--were assayed in serum. Iron, zinc,   and copper concentrations in serum, erythrocytes, and urine were determined using  flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Blood pressure was measured. Diet intake  was monitored at each stage. RESULTS: It was found that the zinc level in serum  significantly decreased following treatment, and that the use of the  optimal-mineral diet during antihypertensive treatment markedly increased zinc  serum concentration. After treatment, a significant increase in zinc excretion in  the urine was observed. Glucose levels in the serum of patients in stage II were   significantly higher than in the baseline. In patients in the diet group, glucose  levels markedly decreased. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between  serum glucose and zinc levels in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive  treatments should include monitoring of mineral status. It seems that the zinc  balance of patients on long-term therapy with hypotensive drugs may benefit from   an optimal-mineral diet."|"patients,diet,zinc,serum,mineral"|"patients,diet,mineral,zinc,serum" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Essential hypertension (HTN) is a multifactorial disease involving   environmental, genetic and other factors. Over the past years, genetic studies of  essential HTN have increased dramatically but the molecular mechanisms involved  are still unknown. As part of a research program coordinated by Boston university  (USA), we studied the role of various genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) in the inheritance or the onset of HTN in African-American,  Caucasian-American and Greek families. METHODS: Among 128 Greek families with a  history of HTN, we studied 1474 people. Of the total examined, 273 men and 286  women were hypertensive. Based on 410 DNA samples from the hypertensive subjects,  different SNPs were examined. An overall meta-analysis of the results from the  Greek families, as well as a comparison with the 2 other groups  (African-Americans and Caucasian-Americans), was performed. RESULTS: We report  SNPs that are associated with the inheritance of HTN and are located either at  the promoters of N-methyltransferase and catalase genes, or within the coding  region of NEDD4L ubiquitin ligase gene, or SNPs in mitochondrial DNA of  hypertensive probands. Furthermore, we clarified the role of hereditary  predisposition in the development of HTN, showing that the presence of maternal  HTN was significantly higher in African-Americans and Greeks compared to  Caucasian-Americans (81.7%, 84.8%, and 65%), while the paternal HTN showed no  such difference (50%, 48.3% and 44.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although  genetic factors that were correlated with HTN were identified, it was not  possible to identify a single gene that should be targeted for the treatment of  HTN. Nevertheless, the important role of the maternal hereditary predisposition  to HTN in the Greek patients and the responsible genetic factors involved should   be further examined."|"htn,snps,greek,genetic,role"|"htn,americans,genetic,greek,snps" 
"AB  - This phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study  compared the efficacy and safety of nifedipine controlled-release (CR) 40 mg  twice daily (b.i.d.) and once daily (q.d.) in 325 Japanese patients with  essential hypertension uncontrolled with nifedipine CR 40 mg q.d.  (ClinicalTrials.gov record: NCT01287260). The primary endpoint was the change  from baseline in trough seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 8 weeks.  Nifedipine CR 40 mg b.i.d. showed significantly greater reductions in trough  seated DBP (-7.7+/-0.6 mm Hg vs. -3.6+/-0.6 mm Hg) and trough seated systolic  blood pressure (BP) (-11.1+/-0.9 mm Hg vs. -3.7+/-0.9 mm Hg) after 8 weeks of  treatment compared with nifedipine CR 40 mg q.d. (both P<0.0001). At week 8, BP  target achievement and responder rates were higher with nifedipine CR 40 mg  b.i.d. (21.5% and 42.4% vs. 10.3% and 19.5%, respectively). Adverse events  considered related to the study drug were reported in 9.0 and 9.7% of patients  receiving nifedipine CR 40 mg b.i.d. and q.d., respectively. The frequency of  drug-related adverse events commonly reported with nifedipine CR (headache, hot  flush, palpitations, peripheral edema, hypotension, dizziness, tachycardia) was  low and the results were similar between the treatment groups. In conclusion, a  higher dose of nifedipine CR was associated with greater efficacy and a safety  profile similar to that of the currently approved dose (40 mg q.d.) in Japanese  patients with essential hypertension, and it may offer a valuable treatment  choice for patients who do not achieve target BP levels with standard treatment."|"nifedipine,cr,treatment,patients,mg"|"cr,nifedipine,40,mg,hg" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related  parameters and cardiorenal metabolic factors is still controversial in clinical  hypertension. METHODS: Normotensive men (NT, n=60) and treated stage 2 and 3  essential hypertensive men (HT, n=89) were enrolled in this study. The  relationship between TNF-related parameters and cardiorenal metabolic factors was  examined in NT and HT, separately. RESULTS: HT showed higher rates of insulin  resistance and enhanced chronic inflammation compared with NT. The levels of  soluble TNF receptor 1 and 2 were significantly higher in HT than in NT, although  TNF-alpha levels were unexpectedly lower in HT than in NT. Regression analysis  indicated that the TNF-related parameters were closely linked with mild renal  dysfunction both in NT and HT, and moderately related to chronic inflammation  only in HT. HT taking inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system showed improved   insulin resistance, but no difference in the TNF-related parameters. CONCLUSION:   These results suggest that the disturbed TNF system is closely linked with  chronic inflammation rather than with insulin resistance in HT."|"ht,nt,tnf,related,parameters"|"ht,tnf,nt,related,parameters" 
"AB  - Magnesium levels have been shown to be associated with elevated blood pressure  (BP), endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, vascular calcification,  inflammation, and atherosclerosis. It was also demonstrated that patients with  hypertension have increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial  dysfunction. However, the relationship between magnesium, ambulatory BPs, and  central hemodynamic parameters were not evaluated extensively. Serum magnesium  levels, ambulatory blood pressures, augmentation index (Aix), pulse wave  velocity, total peripheral resistances, and cardiac output were measured for all   patients. In total, 184 essential hypertension patients were enrolled. In  univariate analysis, magnesium levels were correlated with hemoglobin (r =  +0.155; P = .037), albumin (r = +0.180; P = .018), pulse pressure (daytime; r =  -0.170; P = .021), pulse pressure (24-hour; r = -0.156; P = .035), Aix (daytime;   r = -0.223; P = .002), Aix (nighttime; r = -0.169; P = .022), and Aix (24-hour; r  = -0.247; P = .001). In regression analysis, magnesium levels were independently   and conversely associated with daytime Aix (P < .0001), nighttime Aix (P = .019),  and 24-hour Aix (P < .0001). We suggest that magnesium levels were associated  with Aix but not with total peripheral resistances, pulse wave velocity, cardiac   output, and central BPs. The unique mechanisms related with magnesium and Aix but  not shared by other central parameters needs to be determined."|"magnesium,aix,levels,central,patients"|"aix,magnesium,levels,pulse,24" 
"AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the fixed-dose  combination olmesartan/amlodipine 40/10 mg in patients with moderate essential  hypertension not controlled on candesartan 32 mg. This was a prospective,  single-arm, phase IV study. The primary endpoint was the change in mean daytime  systolic blood pressure (BP). A total of 77 of 89 screened patients started  candesartan 32 mg, 62 olmesartan 40 mg, and 57 olmesartan 40 mg/amlodipine 10 mg.  Mean daytime systolic BP was reduced by 9.8+/-15.2 mm Hg (P<.001) vs candesartan   monotherapy. Office BP reduction was 9.2+/-18.8/5.0+/-8.9 mm Hg (P<0.001).  Treatment goals (<140/90 mm Hg for office and <135/85 mm Hg for ambulatory BP)  were achieved in 58.2% and 78.4% of patients, respectively. There was one  drug-related adverse event (edema) and no serious adverse events. Patients of  Caucasian ethnicity with moderate essential hypertension uncontrolled on  candesartan experienced a further drop in BP using olmesartan and amlodipine."|"bp,patients,candesartan,mg,study"|"mg,bp,candesartan,hg,mm" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the interactions of occupational   stress and glucocorticoid receptor gene (GR) polymorphisms on essential  hypertension (EH) among Chinese railway workers. METHODS: A case-control study  was conducted with 196 EH cases and matched controls from male railway employees.  Occupational stress was scaled by a validated Chinese version of the Occupational  Stress Inventory. Information on risk factors for hypertension, including  smoking, alcohol consumption, family hypertension history and body mass index,  was collected by face to face interviews. Genotypes of GR BCL1 and G678S genes  were determined with PCR-RFLP. Conditional logistic regression was applied to  examine the interactions of occupational stress and GR gene polymorphisms with  adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: A positive relationship was  observed in the CG/GG genotype compared with the CC genotype in the GRBCL1 gene.   The interaction between the GRBCL1 gene and occupational stress was statistically  significant on EH. The odds ratio (OR) was 1.56 (95% CI: 0.93, 2.63) when  comparing the CG/GG genotype of the GRBCL1 gene with low/medium personal strain  with the CC genotype with low/medium strain, whereas the OR was 3.43 (95% CI:  1.45, 8.12) when comparing the same genotype with high strain with the same  reference. A similar pattern of association was observed for the CG/GG genotype  of the GRBCL1 gene with low/medium occupational stress (OR=1.32, 95% CI: 0.76,  2.30) and with high occupational stress (OR=3.58, 95% CI: 1.60, 8.02).  CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the CG/GG genotype in GRBCL1 possibly  interacts with occupational stress in increasing the risk for essential  hypertension in the railway workers, but more studies with larger samples are  needed to confirm the finding."|"occupational,stress,hypertension,gene,genotype"|"occupational,stress,genotype,gene,grbcl1" 
"AB  - AIM: To study signs of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in nondiabetic patients with  controlled arterial hypertension (AH) and glycemic response during first hour of   glucose tolerance test (GTT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients (n = 47) with  controlled AH were divided into 2 groups according to results of GTT with 75 g of  glucose: patients of group 1 (n = 22) had glucose level </= 200 mg/dl during 1-st  hour of GTT; other patients (n = 25) composed group 2. Examination of all  patients included transthoracic echocardiography, ultrasound Dopplerography,  tissue Doppler (TD) and 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring. Using data of these  methods we calculated left ventricular (LV) mass and the following  characteristics of mitral ring: E/A, TD e', TD a', TD s', TD e'/a'/. The  following characteristics of heart rate variability were obtained: standard  deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN), low and high frequency (LF, HF) power,  LF/HF ratio. RESULTS: Patients of group 2 had higher LV mass (229.5 +/- 58.2 vs.   192.1 +/- 50.6 g; p = 0.036), more pronounced changes of TD e'/a' (0.71 +/- 0.25   vs. 1.06 +/- 0.58; p = 0.011), lower SDNN both during day (85.4 +/- 14.1 vs.  112.5 +/- 31.3 ms, p = 0.007) and night (82.2 +/- 22.1 vs. 105.9 +/- 28.5 ms, p =  0,004) time, higher nocturnal LF/HF ratio (3.75 +/- 4.02 vs. 1.72 +/- 0.81, p =  0,029). CONCLUSION: In patients with controlled arterial hypertension (AH) and  glycemic response during first hour of GCT we revealed various pronounced  manifestations of DCM. These data constitute a basis for further studies."|"patients,hour,td,dcm,glucose"|"patients,td,vs,hour,ah" 
"AB  - AIM: To study effect of atorvastatin on spontaneous production of cytokines and  reactive oxygen species by mononuclear leukocytes of blood of hypertensive  patients with metabolic syndrome in vivo and in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We  conducted an 8-week open prospective study on 36 patients with essential stage II  hypertension associated with metabolic syndrome. Along with examination made in  specialized cardiological clinic we assessed spontaneous production of cytokines   and reactive oxygen species by blood mononuclear leukocytes during therapy with  atorvastatin (in vivo). Dynamics of these parameters under the influence of  atorvastatin on suspension of mononuclear leukocytes was also assessed in vitro.   RESULTS: Therapy with atorvastatin (20 to 40 mg/day) facilitated reduction of  serum concentration of acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein and neopterin)  and decrease of spontaneous production by blood mononuclear leukocytes of  proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor  [TNF]-alpha) and reactive oxygen species. Dynamics of cytokine concentrations in   supernatants of mononuclear leukocytes obtained after incubation of the cells  with atorvastatin in vitro confirmed the assumption of direct inhibitory effect  of this drug on spontaneous production of some proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6  and monocyte chemotactic protein-1). Absence of significant lowering of  concentrations of other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) and  expression of reactive oxygen species in vitro evidenced for complex indirect  effect of therapy with atorvastatin on their production."|"vitro,atorvastatin,mononuclear,leukocytes,reactive"|"atorvastatin,cytokines,leukocytes,mononuclear,production" 
"AB  - AIM: to investigate association of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2  (Lp-PLA2) level (mass) with ischemic stroke in patients with essential  hypertension (EH) with or without dyslipidemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined  60 patients with EH without complications and 90patients with EH and history of  ischemic stroke. Examination included measurement of height, weight, waist, blood  pressure and heart rate, determination of glucose, creatinine, lipid profile,  Lp-PLA2 mass, and duplex scanning of carotid arteries. All patients were divided   into 2groups: A) with high (n=70), and B) normal or mildly elevated (n=80) levels  of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC). RESULTS: In group A (LDLC <3.4  mmol/L) Lp-PLA2 mass in patients with stroke was higher than in patients with  uncomplicated EH; age and elevated Lp-PLA2 mass were independently associated  with history of stroke. In group B (LDLC >3.4 mmol/L) Lp-PLA2 mass did not differ  between patients with EH with or without stroke while low level of high density  lipoprotein cholesterol was most significantly associated with history of stroke.  INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the role of LP-PLA2 in the development  of ischemic stroke is reduced in the presence of evident dyslipidemia and high  level of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. However, in the presence of low  level of traditional metabolic risk factors proinflammatory substances and  LP-PLA2 in particular acquire dominant role in the processes of atherogenesis and  plaque destabilization."|"lp,pla2,stroke,patients,mass"|"lp,pla2,stroke,patients,eh" 
"AB  - AIM: to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 4 fixed  irbesartan/amlodipine combinations in hypertensive patients resistant to  monotherapy with 150 mg irbesartan or 5 mg amlodipine in a 16 week prospective  open uncontrolled randomized multicenter study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included  in this study 158 patients with essential arterial hypertension (AH) (mean age  57.6 +/- 10.1 years, 119 women) receiving monotherapy with 150 mg irbesartan  (n=78; 49.4%) or 5 mg amlodipine (n=80; 50.6%). Patients not achieving target  arterial pressure (AP) <140/90 mm (n=149) Hg were given fixed  irbesartan/amlodipine combination 150/5 mg. If target AP was not achieved  patients were randomized to 150/10 or 300/5 mg combinations. If necessary after 4  more weeks these doses were increased to maximal (300/10 mg). Thus 4 fixed  irbesartan/amlodipine combinations were used: 150/5, 150/10, 300/5, 300/10 mg.  Primary criterion of efficacy was portion of patients with target AP at last  visit. Safety was assessed by presence of unfavorable events, clinical and  laboratory parameters. RESULTS: After 16 weeks 43, 23.5, 23.5 and 8.7% of  patients received 150/5, 150/10, 300/5 and 300/10 mg combinations, respectively.   At final visit 93.3% of patients had AP <140/90 mm Hg. Mean AP lowering in the  total group was -21.7 +/- 9.1/-10.9 +/- 10.8mm Hg (<0.0001). There were 2 cases  of ankle edema (5.7%) but no withdrawals due to unfavorable events. There were no  differences between 4 dosing regimens in laboratory and clinical parameters of  safety and tolerability. CONCLUSION: In patients with AH not achieving target AP   on monotherapy with irbesartan 150 or amlodipine 5 mg administration of  irbesartan/amlodipine combination with possibility of dose titration using 4  fixed combinations was effective in 93.3% of patients, resulted in significant  systolic and diastolic AP lowering in all therapeutic groups, was well tolerated   and safe."|"patients,ap,mg,amlodipine,irbesartan"|"mg,10,150,patients,amlodipine" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate endothelial and metabolic effects of perindopril and  their interaction in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. METHODS:  The study involved 30 patients treated with perindopril (5-10 mg/day) for 3  months. The following parameters were registered at baseline and at the end of  the study: body mass index, waist circumference, blood lipids and glucose,  flow-mediated vasodilation (FMVD) of brachial artery assessed by ultrasound.  RESULTS: Treatment with perindopril was associated with significant improvement  of FMVD (6.7 +/- 4.1% versus 8.7 +/- 5.4% at the end of the study, p<0.05) as  well as decrease of blood triglycerides (-18%, p<0.05) and glucose (-9%, p<0.01)   with no significant changes of other metabolic parameters. Correlation analysis  showed no relationship between changes of FMVD and blood pressure during the  study (r= -0.14, p=0.42 r= -0.13, p=0.46 for systolic and diastolic blood  pressure, respectively) whereas inverse association was observed with changes of   blood glucose (r= -0.50, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Thus our data confirm the ability   of perindopril to restore impaired endothelial function in patients with  essential hypertension independently of blood pressure reduction and make  possible to propose its positive metabolic effect relative to changes associated   with insulin resistance. It seems that endothelial effect of perindopril may in  part be related to diminished adverse influence of metabolic changes on vascular   wall."|"perindopril,blood,changes,metabolic,study"|"blood,changes,perindopril,metabolic,study" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare changes of vascular and metabolic parameters in  patients with essential hypertension on treatment with combination of perindopril  with either indapamide retard or hydrochlorothiazide. METHODS: The study involved  40 patients who were randomly assigned to perindopril 5-10 mg/day in combination   with indapamide retard (P+I) 1.5 mg/day (n = 20) or with hydrochlorothiazide  (P+HT) 25 mg/day (n=20). Waist circumference, body mass index, blood lipids and  glucose, endothelial function (EF) determined as the change of resistance index  after inhalation of salbutamol, arterial stiffness measured as mean pulse wave  velocity after sublingual trinitroglycerin (PWVtng) were evaluated at baseline  and 6 months thereafter. Vascular responses were calculated from digital pulse  waves registered using photoplethysmography. RESULTS: Dynamics of BP after 6  months did not differ significantly between groups. Treatment with combination of  P+HT resulted in significant decrease of EF (-24,3%, p<0,05) accompanied by  negative changes of triglycerides (+13,4%, p<0,05) and glucose levels (+9,8%,  p<0,05), whereas combination of P+I did not affect endothelial function and was  metabolically neutral. PWVtng significantly decreases on both regiments of  treatment with the trend in favor of P+I combination (-13,4%, p<0,001 versus  -9,8%, p<0,01 for P+I and P+HT combinations, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thus,  despite the similar BP reduction the combination of ACE-inhibitor--perindopril  with indapamide retard possesses more favorable vascular and metabolic effects  compared to combination with hydrochlorothiazide that potentially may account for  different prognosis of patients with arterial hypertension on long-term  treatment."|"combination,p,vascular,treatment,patients"|"combination,treatment,05,day,ht" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is a common health disorder with uncertain etiology and  unclear pathophysiology. There is evidence that various systems interact in  uncertain ways and mechanisms to cause hypertension. It is also well known that  inflammation is a key feature in the initiation, progression and clinical  implication of several cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it has become evident  that the immune system and inflammatory response are also essential in the  pathogenesis of hypertension. Many inflammation markers such as CRP, cytokines,  and adhesion molecules have been found elevated in hypertensive patients  supporting the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Also, in  normotensive individuals, these markers have been associated with the risk of  developing hypertension, whereas in hypertensive patients they have been  associated with target organ damage as well as with the risk for future  cardiovascular events. Thus, understanding the role of inflammation in  hypertension provides new insights for novel therapeutic approaches, targeting  inflammation for the treatment of hypertension and its complications."|"hypertension,inflammation,also,uncertain,cardiovascular"|"hypertension,inflammation,associated,cardiovascular,essential" 
"AB  - Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) was reported to have impact on the physiological arterial  stiffness and vascular remodeling with hypertension of recent years. In the  previous study we reported the association of four functional single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) of FBN1 gene and hypertension. Here, we further investigate   the association of four tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) which covered remain genetic  variation blocks of FBN1 gene with hypertension, blood pressure and efficacy of  antihypertensive in a South Han Chinese population. A case-control study  including 2,012 hypertension cases and 2,116 controls age- and sex-matched  controls was conducted from a community-based population and four candidate  tagSNPs of the FBN1 gene were genotyped. Association analysis by multiple  logistic regression was conducted for allele, genotype and haplotype and  hypertension, blood pressure trait and control status with antihypertensive.  General linear model was applied to compare blood pressure levels between  genotypes. The association of rs17361868 and hypertension was statistically  significant and that was further observed in female, >/=55 years, non-smoking and  non-drinking populations (P < 0.05). Significant association of rs668842,  rs11635140 and hypertension were observed in <55 years population as well as the   later in female and non-smoking populations respectively. Haplotype G-T  constructed of rs668842 and rs11635140 was significantly associated with  hypertension comparing to reference haplotype A-C (P = 0.022). Normally  distributed square root of TGF-beta1 (pg/ml) of hypertension cases (148.56 +/-  66.46) was significantly higher than that of control (128.52 +/- 65.11), P =  0.008. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 was significantly correlated with SBP (r = 0.135, P  = 0.018) and DBP (r = 0.154, P = 0.007) respectively whereas no statistical  difference of blood pressure or TGF-beta1 was observed between genotypes.  Remarkably, rs17361868 were significantly associated with the status of blood  pressure in the patients taking three of the antihypertensive drugs, Zhen Ju  Jiang Ya tablets, Jiang Ya tablet and compound reserpine (P < 0.05). The present   study provides further association evidence of FBN1 gene polymorphisms and  hypertension, antihypertensive efficacy. Further replication of these results via  association or prospective studies conducted in other populations is warranted."|"hypertension,association,blood,pressure,fbn1"|"hypertension,association,blood,fbn1,pressure" 
"AB  - Over the past 60 years a great progress has been made in our understanding of the  pathogenesis of essential hypertension. The contribution of excessive sympathetic  nerves activity in the development of hypertension and target organ damage has  been demonstrated in experimental and clinical studies. Also the important role  of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron in the pathophysiology of arterial  hypertension has been confirmed in many studies. During the last three decades  many studies revealed the relationship between low birth weight and arterial  hypertension. Sleep disturbances--short sleep duration, insomnia are proposed as   a possible pathophysiological factor of hypertension. The novel concept that  immune system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of essential  hypertension has gained support in recent years. The multifactorial nature of  essential hypertension is now widely accepted."|"hypertension,essential,studies,arterial,important"|"hypertension,essential,studies,arterial,important" 
"AB  - In recent years, much attention has focused on the role of aldosterone and  mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in the pathophysiology of hypertension and  cardiovascular disease. Patients with primary aldosteronism, in whom angiotensin   II levels are low, have a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications than  patients with essential hypertension. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study  (RALES) demonstrated that adding a non-specific MR antagonist, spironolactone, to  a standard therapy that included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,   loop diuretics, and digoxin, significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in  patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Similarly, the Eplerenone  Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study  (EPHESUS) showed that the addition of a selective MR antagonist (ARM),  eplerenone, to an optimal medical therapy reduces morbidity and mortality among  patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular  dysfunction and heart failure. These data suggest that aldosterone induces  cardiac injury through activation of MRs and support the notion that MR blockade   has beneficial effects on aldosterone-dependent cardiac injury, through  mechanisms that cannot be simply explained by hemodynamic changes. Although, MRA   are highly effective in patients with heart failure, the risk of hyperkalemia  should not be overlooked. Serious hyperkalemia events were reported in some MRA  clinical trials; however these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient  selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up."|"patients,heart,failure,mr,aldosterone"|"patients,failure,heart,aldosterone,mr" 
"AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of the  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril 10 mg and the calcium  antagonist amlodipine 5 mg (ekvator) in conjunction with rosuvastatin (mertenil).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation enrolled 50 patients (mean age 57.9  years) with essential hypertension. All the patients received the fixed-dose  antihypertensive combination. Stable Functional Class I or II exertional angina  was in 46% of the patients. The remaining 54% were found to have brachiocephalic   atherosclerosis. All the patients had dyslipidemia and were given rosuvastatin.  RESULTS: The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) initially reached 164.26 mm Hg.  During the whole follow-up, the reduction in mean SBP generally accounted for  22.6% (p = 0.000). At the study inclusion, the mean diastolic blood pressure  (DBP) reached 99.38 mm Hg. The total decline in mean DBP was 19.3% (p = 0.000).  The mean level of total cholesterol (TC) decreased significantly by 32.1% (p =  0.000); that of triglycerides (TG) also fell significantly by 31.8% (p = 0.04);  that of high-density lipoproteins increased insignificantly by 11.1% (p = 0.599);  that of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) dropped significantly by 47.5% (p =  0.000). CONCLUSION: Being safe, the fixed-dose lisinopril and amlodipine  combination is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertensive  disease (HD) concurrent with coronary heart disease (CHD) or atherosclerotic  changes in the carotid artery. The use of rosuvastatin in patients with HD  concurrent with CHD during 2 months causes positive changes in the blood lipid  composition as a significant reduction in the-levels of (TC), LDL, and TG."|"patients,mean,blood,rosuvastatin,combination"|"mean,patients,000,blood,combination" 
"AB  - AIM: To estimate the spread and distribution of genotypes and alleles of  thrombosis predisposition gene polymorphisms in adolescents with essential  hypertension (EH). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-seven 14- to  17-year-old adolescents were examined. There were 3 examined groups: 1) 37 EH  patients with prothrombotic changes (PTC); 2) 60 EH patients without PTC; 3) 40  healthy adolescents. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and  the levels of fibrinogen and soluble fibrin monomer complexes were determined.  The adolescents were assigned to a PTC group if they had changes by one or  several above indicators. Polymerase chain reaction assay was used to type  coagulation factor II (FII) and factor V (FV), plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-7), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and methionine   syntase reductase (MTRR) gene polymorphisms. Group differences were determined by  qualitative signs, by using.the chi2test and Yates' correction for continuity and  Fisher's exact test if one of the groups had at least 5 individuals. All  differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS: FV  R506Q, FII G20210A, PAI1-675 4G/5G, MTHFR A1298C, and MTRR A66G polymorphisms  have not been found to affect the hemostatic system in adolescents with EH. MTHFR  C677T may act as a risk factor of PTC in adolescents with EH, by increasing the  risk of thrombotic events at an old age. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that the  determination of molecular genetic markers for predisposition to thrombosis be  actively used in adolescents with EA to form a risk group for thrombotic events  and to implement preventive measures.."|"adolescents,eh,one,group,polymorphisms"|"adolescents,eh,ptc,factor,group"

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between angiotensin converting enzyme   (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and diabetic essential  hypertension in elderly population. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technique was used in 260 elderly normal control patients, 205 elderly  hypertensive patients and 138 elderly diabetic hypertensive patients to detect  the I/D polymorphism in ACE gene. RESULTS: DD genotype frequency (0.352) and D  allele frequency (0.543) in elderly hypertensive patients were higher than those   in the normal control patients. DD genotype (0.421) and D allele frequency  (0.579) in elderly diabetic hypertensive patients were significantly higher than   those in the control patients (0.133 and 0.250). The differences of DD genotype  and D allele frequency between the elderly hypertensive patients and the elderly   diabetic hypertensive patients were not significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACE  gene deletion is a risk factor for hypertension but is not a risk factor for  diabetes in elderly population."|"elderly,patients,gene,ace,diabetic"|"elderly,patients,hypertensive,diabetic,frequency" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is associated with an increased incidence of  glucose intolerance (prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus) but many persons  with glucose intolerance remain undiagnosed for many years. AIMS: To determine  the frequency of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in a group of hypertensives  and normotensives. METHODS: Anthropometry, blood pressure and standard oral  glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were done in adult participants (hypertensive and  normotensive controls) newly presenting to a General Outpatient Clinic of the  University College Hospital, Ibadan. RESULTS: Using the OGTT, the frequency of  undiagnosed diabetes was 10.4% and 4.3% in hypertensives and normotensives  respectively (p = 0.031) but was 5.2% and 2.6% in hypertensives and normotensives  respectively using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) alone (p=0.308).Using the OGTT,  impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was diagnosed in 32.2% of hypertensives compared  to 14.8% of normotensives (p = 0.002) while impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was  diagnosed in 5.2% of hypertensive and 2.6% of the normotensives (p = 0.288).  After adjusting for hypertension, age, level of education, body mass index and  waist circumference, hypertensives and persons with a higher waist circumference   had statistically significantly increased odds of having glucose intolerance:  hypertension (OR 2.915; 95% CI 1.526-5.556) and waist circumference (OR 1.050;  95% CI 1.010-1.090). CONCLUSION: Diabetes and prediabetes are commoner in  hypertensive persons and such persons require close and frequent monitoring for  the development of this disease. Screening with both fasting plasma glucose and  post glucose load plasma glucose (OGTT) identifies more persons with glucose  intolerance than fasting plasma glucose alone."|"glucose,persons,ogtt,hypertensive,intolerance"|"glucose,hypertensives,normotensives,persons,diabetes" 
"AB  - Only 20-30% out of the treated hypertensive patients in Europe are achieving  blood pressure (BP) control. Among other recognized factors, these poor results  could be attributable to the fact that for many doctors it is very difficult to  detect which is the predominant hemodynamic cause of the hypertension  (hypervolemia, hyperinotropy or vasoconstriction). The aim of the study was to  use non-invasive thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) to evaluate hemodynamic  modulators and subsequent hemodynamic status in uncontrolled hypertensive  patients, receiving at least two antihypertensive drugs. A number of 134  uncontrolled hypertensive patients with essential hypertension were evaluated in   nine European Hypertension Excellence centers by means of TEB (the HOTMAN((R))  System). Baseline office systolic and diastolic BP averaged 156/92 mmHg.  Hemodynamic measurements show that almost all patients (98.5%) presented at least  one altered hemodynamic modulator: intravascular hypervolemia (96.4%) and/or  hypoinotropy (42.5%) and/or vasoconstriction (49.3%). Eleven combinations of  hemodynamic modulators were present in the study population, the most common  being concomitant hypervolemia, hypoinotropy and vasoconstriction in 51(38%)  patients. Six different hemodynamic states (pairs of mean arterial pressure and  stroke index) were found. Data suggest that there is a strong relation between  hypertension and abnormal hemodynamic modulators. This method might be helpful  for treatment individualization of hypertensive patients."|"hemodynamic,patients,hypertension,hypertensive,modulators"|"hemodynamic,patients,hypertension,hypertensive,hypervolemia" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of wuling powder and modified  tianma gouteng decoction as an open add-on therapy for treating essential  hypertension (EH). METHODS: 72 cases of EH patients took wuling powder and  modified tianma gouteng decoction for 2 weeks to treat EH without changing their   former medication. New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart function  classification, heart rate, blood pressure and 6-min walking test were evaluated   before and after treatment. RESULTS: Wuling powder and modified tianma gouteng  decoction decreased the EH patients' heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic  pressure and increased the 6-min walking distance very significantly (P<0.01).  The total effective rate on blood pressure was 91.7%, and the total effective  rate on NYHA heart function improvement was 95.1%. No serious side effect  appeared. CONCLUSION: From this study, treating EH with wuling powder and  modified tianma gouteng decoction as an open add-on therapy seems to be effective  and safe. Further randomized trials are needed to test the positive findings."|"eh,heart,wuling,rate,effective"|"eh,heart,decoction,gouteng,modified" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular  disease. It is known that essential hypertension begins at a very early age.  Recently, there have been reports of an increase in childhood hypertension, which  has been attributed to an increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity.  Obesity-dependent or independent asymptomatic hypertension can only be determined  by random blood pressure measurements in children. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we  aimed to investigate the prevalence of obesity and asymptomatic hypertension  among children living in Bursa, Turkey. METHODS: One thousand children living in   Nilufer district and being served by the Fethiye Bulvar Family Health Care Center  were enrolled in this study. All seven family physicians working at the centre  participated in the study. RESULTS: Eighty-five children (8.5%) were determined  to be hypertensive. One hundred and twelve children (11.2%) were obese. Blood  pressure and body mass index (BMI) increased with age, with peak prevalence of  hypertension at age 12 and of obesity at age 10. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of  obesity and hypertension is high among school-age children in Turkey. Family  physicians should consistently perform blood pressure and BMI measurements as a  part of well child visits through late childhood."|"hypertension,children,age,study,family"|"hypertension,children,age,obesity,prevalence" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Aldosterone plays a detrimental role on the cardiovascular system and  PA patients display a higher risk of events compared with EH. OBJECTIVES: The  objectives of the study were to compare cardio- and cerebrovascular events in  patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) and matched essential hypertension (EH).  METHODS: We retrospectively compared the percentage of patients experiencing  events at baseline and during a median follow-up of 12 years in 270 PA patients  case-control matched 1:3 with EH patients and in PA subtypes  [aldosterone-producing adenoma (n = 57); bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (n = 213)]  vs matched EH. RESULTS: A significantly higher number of PA patients experienced   cardiovascular events over the entire period of the study (22.6% vs 12.7%, P <  .001). At the diagnosis of PA, a higher number of patients had experienced total   events (14.1% vs 8.4% EH, P = .007); furthermore, during the follow-up period, PA  patients had a higher rate of events (8.5% vs 4.3% EH, P = .008). In particular,   stroke and arrhythmias were more frequent in PA patients. During the follow-up, a  higher percentage of PA patients developed type 2 diabetes. Parameters that were   independently associated with the occurrence of all events were age, duration of   hypertension, systolic blood pressure, presence of diabetes mellitus, and PA  diagnosis. After division into PA subtypes, patients with either  aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia displayed a higher  rate of events compared with the matched EH patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study  demonstrates in a large population of patients the pathogenetic role of  aldosterone excess in the cardiovascular system and thus the importance of early   diagnosis and targeted PA treatment."|"patients,pa,events,eh,higher"|"patients,pa,events,eh,higher" 
"AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether epicardial adipose tissue thickness  (EAT), a new cardiometabolic risk factor, is associated with essential  hypertension. The sample included 127 asymptomatic patients with one or more  cardiovascular risk factors consecutively referred for cardiac computed  tomography angiography. Data were collected retrospectively and compared between   hypertensive (n=39) and normotensive (n=88) patients. The hypertensive patients  had a significantly higher mean EAT thickness than the normotensive group  (2.81+/-1.6 mm vs 2.07+/-1.43 mm; P=.011) and a significantly elevated mean  coronary artery calcium score (316.8+/-512.6 vs 108.73+/-215; P=.0257). The odds   ratio for a patient with tissue thickness >/=2.4 mm having hypertension was 1.396  (95% confidence interval, 1.033-1.922). Factors independently associated with  hypertension were body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, and age. A model  score was developed using the logistic regression coefficients for calculation of  individual risk. Hypertensive patients have significantly higher than normal EAT   thickness. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness may serve as a risk indicator for   hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity."|"risk,hypertension,thickness,tissue,patients"|"thickness,hypertension,patients,risk,eat" 
"AB  - Acute ischemia of the brainstem has been known to produce hypertension. After an   initial review of central nervous system mechanisms contributing to systemic  hypertension and the impact of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) on  arterial pressure, the authors propose that essential hypertension involves  neurochemical changes at the level of the RVLM which are triggered by cerebral  ischemia. Experimental and clinical data are presented to show that there is a  link between ischemia of the brainstem and chronic hypertension. Atherosclerosis   of the cerebral circulation leads to ischemia of the RVLM and other regions with   autonomic function. This ischemic process results in increased availability of  angiotensin II in the RVLM, which maintains the chronic hypertensive state via  either direct stimulation of the RVLM or exacerbation of brainstem ischemia due  to increased vasoconstriction."|"rvlm,hypertension,ischemia,brainstem,chronic"|"ischemia,rvlm,hypertension,brainstem,cerebral" 
"AB  - Radiofrequency-induced renal ablation is a non-pharmacologic therapeutic approach  for the treatment of essential resistant hypertension, with a stable blood  pressure lowering effect. However, data from published studies cannot conclude  yet on the long-term efficacy and safety of the procedure. Therefore, the various  techniques of renal nerve ablation (radiofrequency, cryoablation, ultrasounds)  need further evaluation in clinical research trials.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure causes left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a  negative prognostic factor among hypertensive patients. AIM: To assess left  ventricular geometric remodeling patterns in patients with essential hypertension  or with hypertension secondary to parenchymal renal disease. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: We analyzed data from echocardiograms performed in 250 patients with  essential hypertension (150 females) and 100 patients with secondary hypertension  (60 females). The interventricular septum and the left ventricular posterior wall  thickness were measured in the parasternal long-axis. Left ventricular mass was  calculated using the Devereaux formula. RESULTS: The most common remodeling type   in females and males with essential hypertension were eccentric and concentric  left ventricular hypertrophy (cLVH), respectively. Among patients with secondary   arterial hypertension, cLVH was most commonly observed in both genders. The  prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was higher among patients with  secondary hypertension. The left ventricular mass index and the relative left  ventricular wall thickness were higher in males and also in the secondary  hypertension group. Age, blood pressure values and the duration of hypertension,   influenced remodeling patterns. CONCLUSIONS: We documented a higher prevalence of  LVH among patients with secondary hypertension. The type of ventricular  remodeling depends on gender, age, type of hypertension, blood pressure values  and the duration of hypertension."|"ventricular,left,hypertension,patients,secondary"|"hypertension,ventricular,left,patients,secondary" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effects of regular Roselle ingestion on blood  pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with established  moderate essential hypertension. METHODS: This non-randomized quasi-experimental   study was conducted in Kafr El-Shaikh, Egypt, for 8 weeks, from September 2012 to  November 2012. The effects of a 4-week period of regular Roselle ingestion  followed by a 4-week recovery period on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic   blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and heart rates (HR) was studied in 2   equal, gender- and age-matched groups (n=50 each; average age - 50+/-5 years) of   normotensive subjects, and patients with moderate essential hypertension.  Electrocardiographic assessments of LVH were also made prior to, and at the end  of both treatment and recovery periods. RESULTS: Pulse pressure (PP)  significantly fell from baseline values by 10.9% (normotensive group [NG]), 21.2%  (hypertensive group [HG]); SBP by 10% (NG), 19.6% (HG); DBP by 9.5% (NG), 18.7%  (HG), and HR by 14.6% (NG), 17.1% (HG) by the end of week 4 of treatment.  Following treatment cessation, SBP, DBP, PP, and HR returned to pretreatment  levels over 4 weeks. Before intervention, none of the normotensive subjects, but   14 hypertensive patients showed LVH. However, Roselle treatment was associated  with regression of LVH in 10 patients with only 4 patients showing LVH after 4  weeks of treatment. This became 10 patients 4 weeks after ceasing treatment.  CONCLUSION: These findings empirically suggest favorable cardiovascular effects  of Roselle in patients with established moderate essential hypertension."|"treatment,patients,lvh,roselle,pressure"|"patients,treatment,lvh,pressure,10" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence factors of salt-sensitive hypertension and to  observe changes of blood pressures and urinary sodium and potassium excretion in   response to acute oral saline loading among essential hypertensive patients in  China. METHODS: Essential hypertensive patients from Beijing Jinzhan second  community were included in this study. Salt-sensitivity was determined via the  improved Sullivan's acute oral saline loading and furosemide volume-depletion  tests. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to explore influence  factors of salt-sensitive hypertension. Acute oral saline loading induced changes  on blood pressures and urinary sodium and potassium excretion were observed.  RESULTS: Sixty-three salt-sensitive hypertensive patients were classified out of   a total of 342(18.4%) essential hypertensive patients. Salt-sensitive patients  were elder than the non-salt-sensitive patients (P < 0.05) . Binary logistic  regression analysis showed that age (OR = 1.744, 95%CI:0.922-3.300, P > 0.05) ,  gender (OR = 0.728, 95%CI:0.374-1.415, P > 0.05) , total cholesterol level (OR =   1.168, 95%CI:0.882-1.547, P > 0.05) and 24-hour urinary sodium (OR = 0.998,  95%CI:0.995-1.002, P > 0.05) were not influencing factors of salt-sensitivity  among essential hypertensive patients. Bivariate general linear models for  repeated measures showed that there were significant statistical differences on  blood pressures and urinary electrolytes concentrations between the beginning of   trials, 2 hours after acute saline loading and 2 hours after furosemide  volume-depletion(all P < 0.01). There was a greater blood pressures change in  salt-sensitive patients than in non-salt-sensitive patients(all P < 0.01) while  urinary electrolytes concentrations change was similar between two groups(all P >  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, total cholesterol level and 24-hour urinary  sodium are not influencing factors of salt-sensitivity among essential  hypertensive patients in this study. Impaired pressure natriuresis during acute  oral saline loading and furosemide volume-depletion tests is presented in  salt-sensitive essential hypertensive patients."|"salt,patients,sensitive,urinary,acute"|"patients,salt,sensitive,hypertensive,05" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of polymorphisms of PR domain containing 16   gene (PRDM16) with essential hypertension in ethnic Uygur population from  Xinjiang, China. METHODS: Functional regions of the PRDM16 gene were sequenced in  48 Uygur subjects with essential hypertension selected from 480 hypertensive  patients and 819 normotensive controls. Representative variations were genotyped   with TaqMan-PCR method. Association of variations of PRDM16 gene with  hypertension was analyzed. RESULTS: For the 4 genotyped representative variations  (rs2236518, rs2282198, rs2493292 and rs870171), no significant difference in  genotype distribution and allele frequencies has been found between the patient  and control groups (P>0.05). By ANOVA analysis, none of the polymorphisms was  significantly associated with systolic or diastolic blood pressure (P>0.05). Nor   was significant difference in haplotypic frequencies between the two groups  detected (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: We have found no association between the four  polymorphisms (rs2236518, rs2282198, rs2493292 and rs870171) of the PRDM16 gene  with essential hypertension in ethnic Uygur population from Xinjiang."|"polymorphisms,gene,association,prdm16,hypertension"|"gene,hypertension,prdm16,05,association" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: To systematically assess the current clinical evidence of acupuncture  for hypertension. SEARCH STRATEGY: The PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical  Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI),  Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Wan-fang Data in the Cochrane  Library were searched until January, 2013. All the randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) based on acupuncture compared with western medicine, sham acupuncture or  lifestyle intervention in patients with hypertension were included. RCTs were  included as well as combined acupuncture with western medicine compared with  western medicine. In addition, RCTs based on acupuncture compared with sham  acupuncture combined with western medicine in patients with essential  hypertension were included. No language restriction was used. Review Manager 5.1   software was used for data analysis. Study selection, data extraction, quality  assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards.  RESULTS: 35 randomized trials (involving 2539 patients) were included. The  methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated as generally low. Two  trials reported the effect of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture in  combinations of western medicine. Acupuncture significantly reduced SBP (-7.47  mmHg, 95% CI - 10.43 to -4.5, P<0.00001) and DBP (-4.22 mmHg, 95% CI - 6.26 to  -2.18, P<0.0001) and no heterogeneity between studies was detected. However,  other studies had substantial heterogeneity due to the quality of them was poor,   and their sample sizes were not satisfactory as an equivalence study. Five trials  described the adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: While there are some evidences that  suggest potential effectiveness of acupuncture for hypertension, the results were  limited by the methodological flaws of the studies. Therefore, further thorough  investigation, large-scale, proper study designed, randomized trials of  acupuncture for hypertension will be required to justify the effects reported  here."|"acupuncture,hypertension,trials,data,quality"|"acupuncture,trials,hypertension,included,medicine" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone  concentration (PAC) and aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) in patients with  aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the  data of PRA, PAC and ARR from 80 patients with APA, 70 patients with essential  hypertension (EH) and 26 individuals with normal blood pressure (NBP). Patients  with hypertension were further divided into taking anti-hypertensive drug group  (D) and non drug treatment group (ND). All participants received at least one  following tests:ARR screening test, supine-upright position test and saline load   test.Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used for exploring the   best cut-off value of ARR and low PRA. RESULTS: The median and percentages of PRA  (ngxml(-1)xh(-1), 1 ngxml(-1)xh(-1) = 1 microgxL(-1)xh(-1)), PAC (ng/dl, 1 ng/dl   = 27.7 pmol/L) and ARR (ngxdl(-1)/ngxml(-1)xh(-1)) between NBP and EH (ND) groups  showed no differences.Over 90% supine PRA >/= 0.52 and 100% upright PRA >/= 0.52   in the above two groups. On the contrary, 90% APA (ND) patients upright PRA  <0.52. The lowest supine and upright ARR in APA (ND) patients was >/= 24.2 and  >/= 37.5 respectively. ROC analysis suggested that the best screening cut-off  values for APA were supine ARR >/= 26.0, upright ARR >/= 37.0; and low PRA  cut-off value for APA were supine PRA <0.50 and upright PRA < 0.63 respectively.   The sensitivity and specificity for APA diagnosis were about 88.2% and 61.5% when  PAC >/= 10.0 after saline load test. CONCLUSIONS: The distinguishing features of   PRA, PAC and ARR can be used as a diagnostic indexs for the exclusive diagnosis  of APA in various clinical tests. And low PRA cut-off values exist in APA  patients."|"pra,arr,apa,patients,pac"|"pra,apa,arr,patients,upright" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent predictor of  poor prognosis in patients with hypertension. In hypertensive hypertrophy, the  pathophysiological mechanism is the accumulation of collagen in the myocardium.  Fragmented QRS (fQRS) complexes are associated with myocardial fibrosis. METHODS:  The study population included 90 patients with hypertension and a normal coronary  angiogram. The fQRS was defined as the presence of an additional R wave (R'),  notching of the R or S wave, or the presence of fragmentation in two contiguous  leads corresponding to a major coronary artery. Echocardiographic examinations  were performed according to the recommendations of the American Society of  Echocardiography. RESULTS: Forty-five patients who had fQRS and were suitable for  the study criteria were compared with 45 age- and gender-matched patients who did  not have fQRS according to demographic data and echocardiographic findings. The  left ventricular (LV) mass index (g/m(2) ) was significantly higher (P < 0.001)  in the group with fQRS. The wall thickness, diameter, volume, and ejection  fraction (EF) were higher in this group (P < 0.001). Concentric and eccentric  hypertrophy were also higher in this group (P < 0.001). In the logistic  regression analysis, fQRS on ECG was an indicator of LVH in hypertensive patients  (B = 0.064; P < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.066; 95% confidence interval = 1.041-1.092)  CONCLUSION: The LV mass index of the hypertensive patients who had fQRS on their   ECGs was significantly higher than that of the patients who did not, and fQRS on   ECG was an important indicator of LVH in hypertensive patients."|"fqrs,patients,higher,hypertrophy,hypertensive"|"fqrs,patients,001,higher,hypertensive" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The angiotensin-converting enzyme gene is one of the most studied  candidate genes related to atrial fibrillation. Among the polymorphisms of the  angiotensin-converting enzyme gene, the 2350 G/A polymorphism (rs4343) is known  to have the most significant effects on the plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme   concentration. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of  the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2350 G/A polymorphism with atrial fibrillation   in Han Chinese patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: A total of 169  hypertensive patients were eligible for this study. Patients with atrial  fibrillation (n = 75) were allocated to the atrial fibrillation group, and 94  subjects without atrial fibrillation were allocated to the control group. The  PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was used to assess  the genotype frequencies. RESULTS: The distributions of the  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2350 G/A genotypes (GG, GA, and AA, respectively)  were 40.43%, 41.49%, and 18.08% in the controls and 18.67%, 46.67%, and 34.66% in  the atrial fibrillation subjects (p = 0.037). The frequency of the A allele in  the atrial fibrillation group was significantly greater than in the control group  (58.00% vs. 38.83%, p = 0.0007). Compared with the wild-type GG genotype, the GA   and AA genotypes had an increased risk for atrial fibrillation. Additionally,  atrial fibrillation patients with the AA genotype had greater left atrial  dimensions than the patients with the GG or GA genotypes (p<0.01 and p<0.05,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study indicate that the   angiotensin-converting enzyme 2350 G/A polymorphism is associated with atrial  fibrillation and that the A allele shows an increased risk for atrial  fibrillation in Han Chinese patients with essential hypertension."|"atrial,fibrillation,enzyme,converting,angiotensin"|"atrial,fibrillation,angiotensin,converting,enzyme" 
"AB  - TY-0201 (TY) is a new drug absorbed by the transdermal delivery system developed   for the treatment of hypertension, which contains the free base of bisoprolol  fumarate that is widely used. An 8-week randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled study was conducted in hypertensive patients to evaluate the  superiority of TY 8 mg to placebo and the noninferiority of TY 8 mg to bisoprolol  fumarate oral formulation (BO) 5 mg. Changes in diastolic blood pressure (BP)  (primary endpoint) from baseline in the TY 8 mg group, the BO 5 mg group, and the  placebo group were -12.2 mm Hg, -11.8 mm Hg, and -3.7 mm Hg, respectively, with  TY 8 mg demonstrating superiority to placebo and noninferiority to BO 5 mg.  Changes from baseline for systolic BP and pulse rate produced significant  reductions compared with placebo. TY is expected to serve as a new treatment  approach for hypertensive patients."|"ty,placebo,mg,treatment,bisoprolol"|"mg,ty,placebo,bo,group" 
"AB  - A direct switch of candesartan to the fixed-dose combination  olmesartan/amlodipine in uncontrolled hypertension is a frequent clinical  requirement but is not covered by current labeling. An open-label, prospective,  single-arm phase IIIb study was performed in patients with 32 mg candesartan  followed by olmesartan/amlodipine 40/10 mg. The primary endpoint was change in  mean daytime systolic blood pressure (BP). Mean daytime systolic BP was reduced  by 9.2+/-12.6 mm Hg (P<.0001) after substituting candesartan for  olmesartan/amlodipine (baseline BP 140.2+/-9.7 mm Hg). The reduction in office BP  was 9.4+/-18.4/4.0+/-9.6 mm Hg; P<.002). Overall, 61.3% of patients achieved a  target BP <140/90 mm Hg using office BP and <135/85 mm Hg using ambulatory BP  measurement. There were 8 adverse events with a possible relation to study drug  and 1 unrelated serious adverse events. In conclusion, patients with uncontrolled  moderate arterial hypertension being treated using candesartan monotherapy  achieve a further reduction of BP when switched directly to a fixed-dose  combination of olmesartan 40 mg/amlodipine 10 mg."|"bp,candesartan,patients,study,hypertension"|"bp,hg,mm,amlodipine,candesartan" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality, and the early-diagnosis is very important for the prevention of  essential hypertension. Previously, we found that Pin1, the only known enzyme  isomerizing pSer/pThr-Pro motifs in proteins, may gradually become inactive under  conditions of stress such as intracellular acidification and fever.  Interestingly, essential hypertension and the dysfunction of Pin1 often  synchronously occur with the increasing age. Recent evidence indicates that Pin1   primarily increases the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and   the production of nitric oxide (NO) in multiple ways, significantly promoting the  relaxation response of blood vessels and preventing the elevation of blood  pressure. Further, the inhibition of Pin1 results in significantly increased  blood pressure in rats. So, we hypothesized and evaluated the potential of Pin1  to be a new early-diagnostic biomarker as well as a therapeutic drug for  essential hypertension. The unique activity of Pin1 and some epidemiological and   experimental data evidence that the decreased activity of Pin1 may be closely  associated with the development of essential hypertension. The factors that may  impact the activity of Pin1 and correlate with the risk of essential hypertension  were also discussed. These findings indicate that Pin1 plays a key and permanent   role in efficiently preventing the development of essential hypertension, and  that Pin1 may be a promising early-diagnostic biomarker as well as an effective  therapeutic drug for the early-diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of essential   hypertension, potentially decreasing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality."|"pin1,hypertension,essential,may,activity"|"pin1,essential,hypertension,activity,early" 
"AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aging on the changes to the  structure and function of coronary arteries in senile elderly patients with  essential hypertension. Patients (aged 60-80 years) were divided into three  groups. The 195 hypertensive patients were divided into four sub-groups according  to the duration of hypertension. The changes to the coronary arteries (left and  right) of all those patients were tested using the following index by 64 coronary  computed tomography (CT) scans. The 24 h systolic blood pressure (SBP) and other   blood biochemical parameters were assayed for all patients. We found that the  value of the body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC) and low density  lipoproteins (LDL) were lower, but age and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were  higher in the group of very elderly patients with hypertension (Group I; P<0.05)   compared with those of a group of elderly patients with hypertension (Group III).  The left anterior descending branch calcification score (CSLAD), total  calcification score (CST), pulse pressure (PP), the left main branch  calcification score (CSLM), the left circumflex branch calcification score  (CSLCX) were significantly increased in Group I compared with Group III (P<0.01  and P<0.05, respectively). In addition, the 24 h SBP value for Group I was higher  than in the 'very elderly without hypertension' group (Group II). Hence, in  elderly patients, a decrease in the levels of BMI, HDL, TC and LDL accompanies  aging. Furthermore, the decline of arterial compliance and increase in arterial  stiffness develops with age. Aging is more likely to lead to atherosclerosis in  the coronary arteries, particularly in the left main coronary artery and its main  branches. Aging is an uncontrollable risk factor, which plays a crucial role in  coronary artery atherosclerosis."|"patients,coronary,aging,left,group"|"group,patients,coronary,elderly,hypertension"

"AB  - UNLABELLED: A picture of hyperparathyroidism secondary to increased urinary  calcium excretion was found in 116 patients with primary aldosteronism (PA),  compared with 110 essential hypertensives. After medical or surgical treatment in  40 PA patients, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were significantly reduced and  bone mineral density (BMD) significantly increased at the lumbar spine, femoral  neck, and total hip. INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown that aldosterone  induces urinary calcium excretion leading to a reduction of calcemia with  consequent secondary hyperparathyroidism and BMD loss. In patients with PA, this   picture of hyperparathyroidism is significantly improved by treatment with  adrenal surgery or with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. On these  premises, the aim of the present study was to evaluate calcium and phosphate  metabolism parameters in PA patients, compared with patients with essential  hypertension (EH) and the effect of treatment of aldosterone excess on bone  health in PA patients. METHODS: We studied 226 patients: 116 with PA (46 with an   aldosterone-producing adenoma and 70 with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia) and 110   patients with EH. In 40 patients with PA, we evaluated biochemical parameters and  bone mass, using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, at baseline and after a  mean follow-up of 24 months from treatment. RESULTS: In PA patients, compared  with EH, PTH levels and urinary calcium excretion significantly increased while  serum calcium significantly decreased with comparable vitamin D levels. At  follow-up in PA patients, PTH levels were significantly reduced compared with  basal evaluation, despite similar vitamin D amounts. At follow-up, we observed a   significant improvement of the Z-score at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and at   total hip sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous data showing secondary  hyperparathyroidism in PA patients, which is reversible after treatment.  Moreover, this targeted treatment appears to be able to determine a significant  improvement of BMD both at the spine and hip sites."|"patients,pa,treatment,significantly,calcium"|"patients,pa,significantly,treatment,calcium" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of notch3 in the kidneys of patients with  primary hypertension and rats with spontaneous hypertension, and to explore the  relationship of notch3 and hypertension renal fibrosis. METHODS: Thirteen  patients with primary hypertension served as a primary hypertension group (HP  group), and 15 patients with kidney tumor served as a control group (CP group).  The spontaneous hypertensive rats served as a primary hypertension group (SHR  group, n=6), and WKY rats served as a control group (WKY group, n=6). Masson  stainning was used to examine the collagen in the kidneys in the SHR group and  the WKY group. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the levels of  Notch3 in kidneys of the patients and the rats. The expression of snail mRNA in  the kidneys in the SHR group and the WKY group was examined by real-time PCR.  RESULTS: Masson staining showed much more collagen in the SHR group than that in   the WKY group (P<0.05); the expression of Notch3 in the HP group was much higher   than that in the CP group ( 6.741+/-0.231 vs 0.763+/-0.358, P<0.01). The  expression of Notch3 in the SHR group was much higher than that in the WKY group   (5.487+/-0.774 vs 0.421+/-0.163, P<0.01), and The expression of snail mRNA was  much higher in the SHR group than that in the WKY group (0.996+/-0.120 vs  0.208+/-0.090, P<0.01 ). CONCLUSION: Notch3 may be related to the occurrence of  hypertension renal fibrosis."|"group,notch3,hypertension,wky,patients"|"group,hypertension,wky,notch3,shr" 
"AB  - We investigated the relationships between paraoxonase genetic polymorphisms and  essential hypertension in carotid artery atherosclerotic patients. The study  included 353 Han participants and 240 Uighur participants from Xinjiang; they  were further divided into two groups: essential hypertension with carotid artery   atherosclerosis (CAAD group) and essential hypertension without carotid artery  atherosclerosis (control group). Genotypes were detected by PCR, followed by  restriction analyses with specific endonucleases. In Han people, the M allele  frequency was significantly higher in the CAAD group than in the control group.  The CC/CS genotype and C allele frequencies were significantly higher in the CAAD  group than in the control group. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that  PON1 55M allele [odds ratio (OR) = 1.889] and PON2 311C allele (OR = 1.692) are  independent risk factors for CAAD. Combined genotype analysis showed that PON1  55M and PON2 311C alleles are independent risk factors for CAAD (OR = 1.428). In   the Uighur population, the CC/ CS genotype and C allele frequencies were  significantly higher in the CAAD group than in the control group. Logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the PON2 311C allele is an independent risk  factor for CAAD. We conclude that the PON1 55M and PON2 311C alleles are  independent risk factors for CAAD in essential hypertension patients from the  Xinjiang Han population. We also conclude that the PON2 311C allele is a risk  factor for CAAD in essential hypertension patients from the Xinjiang Uighur  population."|"caad,essential,allele,group,hypertension"|"caad,group,allele,311c,essential" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of aranidipine versus  retard-released felodipine in Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate essential  hypertension. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo   and active antihypertensive drug parallel-controlled study. After 2 weeks of  placebo run-in period, 315 patients at 6 centers with diastolic blood pressure  (DBP) between 95 to 109 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) while systolic blood pressure  (SBP) below 180 mm Hg were randomized to receive aranidipine 5-20 mg/d (n = 126)   or retard-released felodipine 5-10 mg/d (n = 126) for 12 weeks. Others (n = 63)  received placebo for 4 weeks. Their blood pressures were evaluated at baseline  and the end of Weeks 4, 8 and 12. RESULTS: After a 12-week treatment, SBP  decreased from 148.8 +/- 10.7 mm Hg to (132.8 +/- 11.2) mm Hg while DBP dropped  from ( 98.4 +/- 2.8) mm Hg to (83.9 +/- 7.5) mm Hg. There were significant  differences with the baseline values (P < 0.0001). After a 4-week treatment, the   reductions of SBP in aranidipine and retard-released felodipine groups were (12.1  +/- 11.0) mm Hg and (12.2 +/- 11.2) mm Hg while the reductions of DBP in two  groups (11.8 +/- 6.9) mm Hg and (12.1 +/- 7.9) mm Hg respectively. The reductions  of SBP and DBP in two groups were (2.3 +/- 8.4) mm Hg and (4.0 +/- 5.1) mm Hg and  they were significantly superior to that in placebo group (P < 0.0001). But no  significant difference existed between aranidipine and retard-released felodipine  groups. Also no significant differences were found between these two  antihypertensive therapy groups at the end of Weeks 4, 8 and 12 in the reduction   of blood pressure, total response rate and blood pressure control rate. But 20 mg  daily aranidipine was significantly superior to 10 mg daily retard-released  felodipine in the control rates of SBP and DBP. Adverse events occurred at 24.22%  and 29.92% in aranidipine and retard-released felodipine groups respectively (P =  0.305). CONCLUSION: Administration of aranidipine 5-20 mg/d can effectively  control blood pressure and is not inferior to retard-released felodipine 5-10  mg/d. The efficacy of 20 mg/d aranidipine is superior to that of retard-released   felodipine 5-10 mg/d. And the effectiveness and safety of aranidipine are similar  to those of retard-released felodipine."|"aranidipine,blood,placebo,felodipine,retard"|"hg,mm,aranidipine,felodipine,released" 
"AB  - Coronary artery disease, heart failure, fatal arrhythmias, stroke, and renal  disease are the most common causes of mortality for humans, and essential  hypertension remains a major risk factor. Elucidation of susceptibility loci for   essential hypertension has been difficult because of its complex, multifactorial   nature involving genetic, environmental, and sex- and age-dependent nature. We  investigated whether the 11p15.5 region syntenic to rat chromosome 1 region  containing multiple blood pressure quantitative trait loci (QTL) detected in Dahl  rat intercrosses harbors polymorphisms that contribute to  susceptibility/resistance to essential hypertension in a Sardinian population.  Initial testing performed using microsatellite markers spanning 18 Mb of 11p15.5   detected a strong association between D11S1318 (at 2.1 Mb, P = 0.004) and  D11S1346 (at 10.6 Mb, P = 0.00000004), suggesting that loci in close proximity to  these markers may contribute to susceptibility in our Sardinian cohort. NLR  family, pyrin domain containing 6/angiotensin-vasopressin receptor (NLRP6/AVR),  and adrenomedullin (ADM) are in close proximity to D11S1318 and D11S1346,  respectively; thus we tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within  NLRP6/AVR and ADM for their association with hypertension in our Sardinian  cohort. Upon sex stratification, we detected one NLRP6/AVR SNP associated with  decreased susceptibility to hypertension in males (rs7948797G, P = 0.029; OR =  0.73 [0.57-0.94]). For ADM, sex-specific analysis showed a significant  association between rs4444073C, with increased susceptibility to essential  hypertension only in the male population (P = 0.006; OR = 1.44 [1.13-1.84]). Our   results revealed an association between NLRP6/AVR and ADM loci with male  essential hypertension, suggesting the existence of sex-specific NLRP6/AVR and  ADM variants affecting male susceptibility to essential hypertension."|"hypertension,susceptibility,avr,essential,nlrp6"|"hypertension,essential,susceptibility,adm,avr" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a critical role in  maintaining the integrity of vascular endothelium following arterial injury.  Lacidipine has a beneficial effect on endothelium of hypertensive patients, but  limited data are available on EPCs-mediated endothelial protection. This study  tests the hypothesis that lacidipine treatment can improve endothelial repair  capacity of EPCs from hypertensive patients through increasing CXC chemokine  receptor four (CXCR4) signaling. METHODS: In vivo reendothelialization capacity  of EPCs from hypertensive patients with or without in vitro lacidipine treatment   was examined in a nude mouse model of carotid artery injury. Expression of CXCR4   and alteration in migration and adhesion functions of EPCs were evaluated.  RESULTS: Basal CXCR4 expression was markedly reduced in EPCs from hypertensive  patients compared with normal subjects. In parallel, the phosphorylation of Janus  kinase-2 (JAK-2) of EPCs, a CXCR4 downstream signaling, was also significantly  decreased. Lacidipine promoted CXCR4/JAK-2 signaling expression of in vitro EPCs.  Transplantation of EPCs pretreated with lacidipine significantly accelerated in  vivo reendothelialization. The enhanced in vitro function and in vivo  reendothelialization capacity of EPCs were inhibited by shRNA-mediated knockdown   of CXCR4 expression or pretreatment with JAK-2 inhibitor AG490, respectively. In   hypertensive patients, lacidipine treatment for 4 weeks also resulted in an  upregulation of CXCR4/JAK-2 signaling of EPCs, which was associated with  augmented EPCs-mediated reendothelialization and improved endothelial function.  CONCLUSION: Deterioration of CXCR4 signaling may lead to impaired EPCs-mediated  reendothelialization of hypertensive patients. Lacidipine-modified EPCs via a  partially CXCR4 signaling contribute to enhanced endothelial repair capacity in  hypertension."|"epcs,cxcr4,lacidipine,hypertensive,signaling"|"epcs,cxcr4,lacidipine,hypertensive,patients" 
"AB  - AIMS: slc26a proteins are responsible for a large number of functions either in  normal physiology or in human disease. We have previously reported that proximal   tubular epithelial (PTE) cells immortalized from spontaneously hypertensive rats   (SHRs) were endowed with increased Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger activity and slc26a6  protein expression compared with PTE cells immortalized from normotensive Wistar   Kyoto (WKY) rats. The aim of the present study was to identify slc26a members  responsible for the Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchange in WKY and SHR PTE cells. MAIN  METHODS: Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger activity was assessed as the initial rate of pHi  recovery after removal of HCO3(-) or after removal of Cl(-). The presence of  slc26a genes was evaluated by means of reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in WKY   and SHR PTE cell lines and in the kidney of WKY and SHR. Transcript abundance was  measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). KEY FINDINGS:  We detected slc26a4, slc26a6, slc26a7 and slc26a9 transcripts in the rat kidney  of WKY and SHR. In WKY and SHR PTE cell lines we detected slc26a4, slc26a6 and  slc26a9 transcripts, which were, respectively, 12-, 4- and 15-fold upregulated in  SHR cells. Gene silencing with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting slc26a4,  slc26a6 and slc26a9 reduced Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger activity in both cell lines.   SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger activity is  mediated by, at least in part, slc26a4, slc26a6 and slc26a9 in cultured WKY and  SHR cells. The overexpression of these slc26a members in SHR cells may correspond  to an adaptive process to cope with the sustained increase in proximal tubular  sodium reabsorption."|"cells,shr,hco3,cl,wky"|"shr,wky,cells,cl,hco3" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Yoga is thought to be effective for health conditions. The article  aims to assess the current clinical evidence of yoga for Essential hypertension  (EH). STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled   Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library were searched until June, 2013. We  included randomized clinical trials testing yoga against conventional therapy,  yoga versus no treatment, yoga combined with conventional therapy versus  conventional therapy or conventional therapy combined with breath awareness.  Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were  conducted according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies  (involving 386 patients) were included. The methodological quality of the  included trials was evaluated as generally low. A total of 6 RCTs met all the  inclusion criteria. 4 of them compared yoga plus conventional therapy with  conventional therapy. 1 RCT described yoga combined with conventional therapy  versus conventional therapy combined with breath awareness. 2 RCT tested the  effect of yoga versus conventional therapy alone. 1 RCT described yoga compared  to no treatment. Only one trial reported adverse events without details, the  safety of yoga is still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: There is some encouraging  evidence of yoga for lowering SBP and DBP. However, due to low methodological  quality of these identified trials, a definite conclusion about the efficacy and   safety of yoga on EH cannot be drawn from this review. Therefore, further  thorough investigation, large-scale, proper study designed, randomized trials of   yoga for hypertension will be required to justify the effects reported here."|"yoga,trials,quality,cochrane,conventional"|"yoga,conventional,therapy,trials,combined" 
"AB  - The high prevalence of alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity and increased  incidence of essential hypertension (EH) in China indicates that there may be an   interaction between alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity on EH risk.  Therefore, we aimed to examine the independent and combined effects of alcohol  consumption and abdominal obesity on risk of EH in a Chinese cohort. We analyzed   data from a population-based prospective cohort of 2778 participants aged 35-74  years from Jiangsu China who were free of hypertension, diabetes and CVD at  enrollment and were followed for hypertension events. Cox proportional hazards  regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of hypertension and   corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Logistic regression model was used to  examine the interaction between alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity on risk  of hypertension. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, family history of   hypertension, current alcohol consumption significantly increased EH risk.  Compared with those without alcohol consumption, the hazard ratio of EH for  participants with alcohol consumption was 1.65 (95% confidence interval  1.29-2.12). There was a statistically significant additive interaction between  current alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity on EH risk. The risk of EH for   current alcohol consumers with abdominal obesity was 4.49 times as high as the  sum of risks in participants with a single condition alone. Both alcohol  consumption and abdominal obesity are strong risk factors of EH in the Chinese  population. Moreover, this study further demonstrates an additive interaction of   alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity on EH risk."|"hypertension,alcohol,consumption,eh,abdominal"|"alcohol,consumption,eh,abdominal,obesity" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal left ventricular (LV) geometric patterns, particularly  concentric LV hypertrophy, are associated with a greater risk of hypertensive  complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between  LV myocardial performance index (LVMPI) and aortic distensibility (AD) with  different LV geometric patterns in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension  (HT). METHODS: We studied 181 patients with newly diagnosed HT (mean age 51.7 +/-  5.4 years) and 39 healthy control subjects (mean age 51.2 +/- 5.1 years).  Echocardiographic examination was performed in all subjects. Four different  geometric patterns were determined in hypertensive patients according to LV mass   index (LVMI) and relative wall thickness (RWT). AD was calculated from the  echocardiographically derived ascending aorta diameters and haemodynamic pressure  measurements. LVMPI was calculated from the tissue Doppler-derived ejection time,  isovolumic contraction and relaxation times. RESULTS: The highest LVMPI and the  lowest AD values were observed in concentric hypertrophy group compared with  control, normal geometry, concentric remodelling and eccentric hypertrophy groups  (p < 0.05, for all). LVMPI was associated with LVMI (r = 0.497, p < 0.001), RWT  (r = 0.270, p < 0.001), AD (r = -0.316, p < 0.001) and E deceleration time (r =  0.171, p = 0.02) in bivariate analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis,  LVMPI was independently related to LVMI (beta = 0.381, p < 0.001) and AD (beta =   -0.263, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The LVMPI was highest and AD was lowest in  patients with concentric hypertrophy. The LVMPI was independently associated with  LVMI and AD in hypertensive patients."|"lvmpi,lv,ad,patients,concentric"|"ad,lvmpi,001,lv,patients" 
"AB  - Percutaneous renal denervation has emerged as an effective adjunct in the  management of resistant hypertension. However, the limits of the renal anatomical  criteria that can be successfully treated are still unknown. In this report, we  describe the case of a middle-aged man with essential resistant hypertension and   two small left accessory renal arteries that underwent renal denervation of both   principal renal arteries. He responded well with a progressive reduction in blood  pressure measuring of 16/10, 32/17 and 45/24 mmHg at 1, 6 and 12 months,  respectively. At 12 months, 94% of ambulatory measurements were below 140/90 mmHg  and the number of anti-hypertensive medications had decreased from six to three.   Thus, it would appear that the presence of two non-ablated left accessory renal  arteries does not influence the response to renal denervation."|"renal,two,resistant,hypertension,arteries"|"renal,arteries,denervation,12,accessory" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HT) is one of the main conditions associated with left   ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Epicardial fat tissue (EFT) serves as a  source of a plenty of proinflammatory cytokines and is associated with increased   cardiovascular events. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the relation   among echocardiographically measured EFT thickness, systemic inflammation, and LV  diastolic dysfunction in patients with essential HT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The  study included 135 newly diagnosed and untreated hypertensive outpatients. On the  basis of conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging-derived parameters,  patients were divided into two groups: 60 patients with normal diastolic function  and 75 patients with LV diastolic dysfunction. EFT thickness was measured from  the parasternal long-axis view at end-systole and high-sensitivity C-reactive  protein (hs-CRP) was assessed using the latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric  method. RESULTS: In patients with LV diastolic dysfunction, EFT thickness was  significantly increased compared with the normal diastolic function group (7.9  +/- 1.7 vs. 6.3 +/- 1.5 mm; P < 0.001, respectively). Serum hs-CRP level was also  significantly higher in the LV diastolic dysfunction group (P < 0.001) and was  correlated with EFT thickness (r = 0.442, P < 0.001). In stepwise multivariate  logistic regression analysis, EFT thickness (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence  interval 1.12-1.43; P = 0.006) and hs-CRP level (odds ratio 1.42, 95% confidence   interval 1.18-1.72; P = 0.003) emerged as independent positive predictors of LV  diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In patients with newly diagnosed and untreated  essential HT, increased EFT thickness and hs-CRP level are significantly related   to impaired LV diastolic function independent from other factors, including age,   waist circumference, and 24-h systolic blood pressure."|"eft,diastolic,thickness,lv,patients"|"diastolic,eft,lv,patients,dysfunction" 
"AB  - We studied the association between of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) gene  polymorphism and risk of essential hypertension development depending on alcohol   drinking habit in unrelated men in Russian population (patients with essential  hypertension and healthy volunteers). All participants were genotyped for four  CYP2E1 gene polymorphisms -1293G>C (rs3813867), -1053C>T (rs2031920), 7632T>A  (rs6413432), and 9896C>G (rs2070676) by PCR and restriction analysis. We found  statistically significant associations between -1293C allele (OR=5.04, 95%  CI=1.23-20.70, p=0.03) and -1293GC genotype (OR=5.36, 95% CI=1.28-22.50, p=0.03)   with increased risk of essential hypertension in men. Stratified analysis on  alcohol drinking habit showed that the presence of -1293C allele (OR=6.82, 95%  CI=1.12-41.70, p=0.04) and -1293GC genotype (OR=7.61, 95% CI=1.2-48.4, p=0.03) in  men with alcohol abuse increases the risk of essential hypertension. The obtained  data suggest that excessive alcohol consumption and increased induction of  cytochrome in the carriers of -1293C allele of CYP2E1 gene lead to generation of   highly reactive free radical oxidation products. These processes induced  oxidative stress and endothelial induction, which served as the pathogenetic  basis for essential hypertension."|"hypertension,c,essential,alcohol,gene"|"essential,hypertension,95,alcohol,ci" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Essential hypertension is associated with multiple metabolic  abnormalities, among them one of the most important is hyperinsulinemia.  Hyperinsulinemia has been suggested as being responsible for the increased  arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension. But this is  contradicted by the finding that all patients of essential hypertension are not  hyperinsulinemic. The present study was conducted to explore the hypothesis that   hyperinsulinemia plays a pathogenic role in hypertension in euglycemic North  Indian population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 120 subjects were studied (60  hypertensive and 60 normotensive). Blood pressure, fasting insulin levels, lipid   profile and BMI were calculated for both the groups. Statistical analysis was  done using online statistical software freely at www.openepi.com. RESULTS:  Hypertensive subjects were characterized by increased fasting insulin levels  (16.77+/-7.62 vs. 8.84+/-2.04muIU/ml, p<0.01), increased BMI (p<0.01) and  dyslipidemia, i.e. increased total cholesterol, high serum triglycerides, high  LDL-C and low HDL-C with p<0.01. There was a positive correlation of fasting  insulin levels with BMI, total cholesterol and LDL-C (p<0.01) and a negative  correlation with HDL-C (p<0.05). However, serum insulin levels showed a non  significant correlation with mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure  (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant increase in serum insulin  levels in hypertensive patients thereby supporting a possible pathogenic role of   insulin resistance in onset of hypertension even when the fasting blood sugar is   within normal limits."|"insulin,hypertension,levels,increased,fasting"|"insulin,hypertension,levels,01,fasting" 
"AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic value of serum ECM  biomarkers in hypertensive patients with no history of cardiovascular events. In   a community-based cohort study of 125 hypertensive patients free of  cardiovascular events, we collected clinical data and blood samples to assess  serum levels of amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP),  matrix metalloproteinase type 1(MMP1) and tissue inhibitor of MMPs type 1(TIMP1).  Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was assessed using the ECG Cornell product.  Patients were followed up for death or cardiovascular hospitalisation. We used  Cox regression models to assess the prognostic value of ECM biomarkers. The  sample included 60.8% women; the mean (+/-SD) age was 62.9 (+/-11.4) years.  Patients were followed up for a median of 5.5 years, during which 23 events (five  deaths) occurred. PIIINP (3.2 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.8 mug/L, P = 0.001) and TIMP1  (886 +/- 168 vs. 751 +/- 202 mug/L, P < 0.001) levels were higher in the presence  of LVH than with no LVH. Basal MMP1 serum levels were significantly associated  with CV events (MMP1: HR, 1.06; 95%CI [1.02-1.09]). Adjusting for confounders did  not modify this result. Cardiac fibrosis, as assessed with serum ECM biomarkers,   might develop early in hypertensive patients and is predictive of cardiovascular   events or death."|"serum,events,patients,ecm,levels"|"events,patients,cardiovascular,serum,biomarkers" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is a frequent, chronic, age-related disorder, which  remains a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease despite  important advances in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Previous studies   have noted a consistent maternal effect on blood pressure (BP). Consequently,  mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have become an additional target of  investigations on the missing BP heritability. Among these mutations, mt-transfer  RNA (tRNA) is a hot mutational spot for pathogenic mutations associated with EH.   Mutant mtDNA aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction, pivotally contributing to the   clinical phenotype. Moreover, the damaged mitochondria, due to their inability to  provide the high-energy requirements for cells, generate reactive oxygen species   (ROS) and induce mitochondrial-mediated cell death pathways. Therefore,  mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of EH. This  review summarizes the basic knowledge of mitochondrial genetics and EH-associated  mtDNA mutations and further discusses the molecular mechanisms behind these mtDNA  mutations in clinical manifestations of EH."|"mitochondrial,mutations,eh,mtdna,dysfunction"|"eh,mitochondrial,mutations,mtdna,associated" 
"AB  - High level of circulating red cell distribution width (RDW) and  neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio may reflect ongoing vascular inflammation and  play an important role in pathophysiology of hypertension. We evaluate the  effects of nebivolol and metoprolol on the RDW and N/L in new essential  hypertensive patients. After baseline assessment, 72 patients were randomly  allocated to 5 mg/d of nebivolol (n = 37, 20 men) or 100 mg/d of metoprolol (n =   35, 18 men) and treated for 6 months. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), RDW,   and N/L were measured before and after treatment. BP significantly decreased with  both drugs (P < 0.001). Analog reduction was observed for resting HRs (P <  0.001), but metoprolol caused greater HR fall as compared with nebivolol (P <  0.001). After 6 months of treatment, nebivolol significantly lowered not only RDW  but also the total white blood cell and N/L (P < 0.001, P = 0.023, P = 0.017,  respectively). No changes were observed in metoprolol group. Percent decrease in   RDW was found to be significantly higher in nebivolol than in the metoprolol  group (P = 0.001) and remained also after correction for confounders (P = 0.012).  Nebivolol improved RDW and N/L to a greater extent than metoprolol in patients  with hypertension. These favorable effects may participate, together with the BP   reduction, at the favorable properties of the drug in hypertension."|"rdw,metoprolol,nebivolol,bp,significantly"|"metoprolol,nebivolol,rdw,001,bp" 
"AB  - CONTEXT: We describe the clinical investigation of the first generation  aldosterone synthase inhibitor, LCI699, in patients with essential, uncontrolled,  resistant, or secondary hypertension. LCI699 competitively reduced blood pressure  at lower doses yet counterintuitive effects were observed at higher doses.  OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: An extensive endocrine biomarker analysis was performed to   better understand the pharmacological mechanism of the drug. RESULTS: The  interference of LCI699 in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurred with   limited target selectivity, as a dose-dependent compensatory stimulation of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal feedback axis was discovered. Thus, LCI699  affected two endocrine feedback loops that converged at a single point,  inhibiting the 11beta-hydroxylase reaction in the adrenal gland, leading to  supraphysiological levels of 11-deoxycortiscosterone. The accumulation of this  potent mineralocorticoid may explain the blunted blood pressure response to  LCI699. CONCLUSION: Future aldosterone synthase inhibitors may improve their  target selectivity by sparing the 11beta-hydroxylase reaction and preferentially   inhibiting one of the two other enzymatic reactions mediated by aldosterone  synthase."|"lci699,aldosterone,synthase,endocrine,may"|"lci699,aldosterone,synthase,11beta,adrenal" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: In hypertensive patients the propensity to develop organ damage is  under the influence of several factors, including the existence of a  prothrombotic state. We tested the hypothesis that an activated hemostatic system  is associated with left-ventricular diastolic dysfunction as assessed by  tissue-Doppler imaging (TDI). METHODS: In 198 patients with untreated essential  hypertension free of clinically relevant cardiovascular complications, we  measured plasma levels of fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, D-dimer,  plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue plasminogen activator, and  performed conventional echocardiography and TDI. RESULTS: Left-ventricular  diastolic dysfunction was detected in 61 patients (31%) by conventional  echocardiography and in 105 patients (53%) by TDI, 39% of whom had  left-ventricular hypertrophy. Left-ventricular hypertrophy was associated with  increased plasma fibrinogen and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels. Patients with   diastolic dysfunction at TDI were older and had greater BMI, SBP,  left-ventricular mass index, and plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels than  patients with normal diastolic function. Variables of diastolic function measured  both at conventional echocardiography and TDI were significantly related with  age, BMI, left-ventricular mass index, and plasma fibrinogen, D-dimer, and  prothrombin fragment 1 + 2. Multivariate regression analysis showed that  diastolic variables obtained at TDI were related to plasma fibrinogen levels  independent of covariates. CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen and a  prothrombotic state are associated with the presence of left-ventricular  diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients with no evidence of ischemic heart  disease and might increase the risk of diastolic heart failure."|"diastolic,patients,tdi,left,plasma"|"diastolic,left,patients,ventricular,fibrinogen" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is associated with an exaggerated natriuresis in response   to intravenous infusion of isotonic saline. We examined proximal tubular fluid  output and segmental tubular handling of sodium in conscious spontaneously  hypertensive rats (SHR), their normotensive counterparts Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY),  and ordinary Wistar rats using servo-controlled sodium and fluid balance and Li  clearance technique. Sodium (Na) excretion rose to 2.72 +/- 0.75 (by a factor of   8) and 1.73 +/- 0.68 mumol/min (by a factor of 6.3) (p < 0.05) in SHR and WKY,  respectively, thus confirming the presence of exaggerated natriuresis in SHR.  FE(Li) rose to 34 +/- 4 and 29 +/- 2 (p < 0.05) and C(Na)/C(Li) rose to 3.0 +/-  0.8 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.05) in SHR and WKY, respectively, demonstrating that  Na reabsorption in both the proximal and the distal nephron was involved.  Additional experiments showed that giving the rats saline instead of water to  drink for four days prior to the clearance measurement led to a remarkable  increase in the natriuretic response to volume expansion. There was a close  correlation between the peak increase in FE(Na) and the logarithmic values of the  baseline FE(Na) values. In conclusion, the study confirms the presence of an  exaggerated natriuresis in response to volume expansion in conscious SHR rats  compared to WKY rats, and that the renal response to acute volume expansion is  related to the baseline sodium excretion."|"rats,shr,response,na,sodium"|"rats,na,shr,response,sodium" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between plasma total antioxidant status  (TAS) and association with brachial-ankle pulsewave velocity (baPWV) in the  elderly patients with essential hypertension(EH). METHODS: A total of 133  consecutive EH patients older than 60 years were enrolled and another 92 elderly   non-EH healthy subjects served as control. According to blood pressure level, EH   patients were further classified into three subgroups. The concentration of  plasma total antioxidant status was measured by using chemical luminescence  method. High-sensitive CRP, urine microalbumin, uric acid, blood lipids and blood  glucose levels were also measured. Carotid intima-media thickness was determined   by color Doppler ultrasonography and the degree of arteriosclerosis was  investigated with baPWV and ankle-brachial index (ABI). RESULTS: (1) Plasma  levels of TAS in EH patients were significant lower than in control group [(1.123  +/- 0.126)mmol/L vs. (1.258 +/- 0.125) mmol/L, P < 0.05], and were similar among   hypertension subgroups (P > 0.05).(2) Stepwise multiple regression analysis  showed that age, gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic  blood pressure, high-sensitive CRP, UA were dependent variables of TAS.  Multivariate regression analysis showed that high-sensitivity CRP, UA were  independent factors affecting TAS (beta = -0.03, standardized beta = -0.01, P <  0.05). (3) Compared with the control group, baPWV was significantly higher in  elderly EH patients left baPWV (1914 +/- 341) cm/s vs. (1817 +/- 322) cm/s, right  baPWV (1899 +/- 330) cm/s vs. (1772 +/- 345) cm/s(P < 0.05)and baPWV tended to  increase with the level of blood pressure of EH group (P < 0.05) . (4) After  adjusting for age, CRP, UA, partial correlation analysis showed that plasma TAS  was negatively correlated with baPWV (r = -0.459, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our  results indicate that TAS and arterial elasticity are decreased while arterial  stiffness is increased in elderly hypertensive patients. The decline in  antioxidant capacity may be responsible for vascular damage and arterial  elasticity decrease in elderly EH patients."|"eh,patients,tas,bapwv,blood"|"eh,bapwv,patients,05,blood" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of different antihypertensive strategies on  blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in patients with hypertension and  microalbuminuria. METHODS: For this multi-center, randomized, positively  controlled clinical trial, a total of 531 patients with mild-to-moderate  essential hypertension and microalbuminuria were enrolled. They were divided  randomly into calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin II receptor antagonist  (ARB) and CCB+ARB groups. The whole treatment period was 6 months. RESULTS:  According to ANOVA analysis, the post-therapeutic urinary albumin level decreased  20.6, 27.6 and 30.9 mg/L in CCB, ARB and CCB+ARB groups respectively (P = 0.067).  And the extents of urinary albumin reduction were 31.1 and 6.6 mg/L in patients  with controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure respectively (P < 0.001).  CONCLUSION: Effective antihypertensive therapy is a key for decreasing urinary  albumin excretion in hypertensive patients. As compared with calcium antagonists,  ARB-containing regimens appear to be better in reducing urinary albumin."|"urinary,albumin,patients,arb,antihypertensive"|"albumin,arb,urinary,ccb,patients" 
"AB  - We found that cluster determinant 36 (CD36) gene is up-regulated in essential  hypertension (EH) patients in our former research, but the association between  CD36 gene variations and EH has not yet been clearly demonstrated. The  relationship between CD36 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and EH in  the northeastern Han Chinese was examined in the present study through direct  sequencing and genotype-detection. A total of 589 unrelated northeastern Han  Chinese including 276 with EH and 313 controls were studied. SNPs in exon 7, exon  13 and intron 4 were detected using PCR-sequencing. The genotypes were determined  by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)   or polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP).   +216T/C, +273A/G, +132C/T, +217T/C, +212T/G and +233T/C polymorphisms were  identified. Distributions of genotypes AA, GA and GG of +273A/G polymorphism were  significantly different between EH group and the control group (chi2: 9.056,  p=0.011) and G allelic frequency was higher in EH (p=0.006, OR=1.629, 95% CI  [1.224-2.168]). Logistic regression analysis showed that +273A/G polymorphism was  closely associated with blood pressure (BP) after adjusting for ages. When  subclassified by sex, the genotype distribution of +273A/G (p=0.011) and allelic   frequency of G allele (p=0.006) were significantly different between EH  participants and controls in males, but not in females. Subgroup analysis  performed by body mass index (BMI) suggested that the genotype distribution of  +273A/G and allelic frequency were significantly different in non-obese group and  non-obese men, but the associations were not significant (non-obese group:  p=0.016, OR=1.664, 95% CI [1.459-2.409]; non-obese men: p=0.073, OR=1.898, 95% CI  [1.033-3.487]). +273A/G polymorphism in CD36 gene was associated with EH, and  +273G could be an independent predictor."|"eh,polymorphism,cd36,gene,pcr"|"eh,273a,polymorphism,cd36,gene" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: beta-blockers (BBs) with different pharmacological properties may have  heterogeneous effects on sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) and central aortic  pressure (CAP), which are independent cardiovascular factors for hypertension.  Hence, we analyzed the effects of bisoprolol and atenolol on SNA and CAP in  hypertensive patients. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled  study in 109 never-treated hypertensive subjects randomized to bisoprolol (5 mg)   or atenolol (50 mg) for 4-8 weeks. SNA, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart  rate (HR) variability (HRV) were measured using power spectral analysis using a  Finometer. CAP and related parameters were determined using the SphygmoCor device  (pulse wave analysis). RESULTS: Both drugs were similarly effective in reducing  brachial BP. However, central systolic BP (-14+/-10 mm Hg vs -6+/-9 mm Hg;  P<0.001) and aortic pulse pressure (-3+/-10 mm Hg vs +3+/-8 mm Hg; P<0.001)  decreased more significantly with bisoprolol than with atenolol. The augmentation  index at a HR of 75 bpm (AIxatHR75) was significantly decreased (29%+/-11% to  25%+/-12%; P = 0.026) in the bisoprolol group only. Furthermore, the change in  BRS in the bisoprolol group (3.99+/-4.19 ms/mmHg) was higher than in the atenolol  group (2.66+/-3.78 ms/mmHg), although not statistically significant (P>0.05). BRS  was stable when RHR was controlled (RHR</=65 bpm), and the two treatments had  similar effects on the low frequency/high frequency (HF) ratio and on HF.  CONCLUSION: BBs seem to have different effects on arterial distensibility and  compliance in hypertensive subjects. Compared with atenolol, bisoprolol may have   a better effect on CAP.

"AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which heme oxygenase (HO) improves glucose  metabolism in essential hypertension are not completely understood. Because  dysfunctional insulin signaling is associated with elevated inflammation and high  cholesterol and triglycerides, we investigated the effects of HO on the  proinflammatory macrophage M1 phenotype and the anti-inflammatory macrophage M2  phenotype in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). SHRs are a model of human  essential hypertension with features of metabolic syndrome, including impaired  glucose metabolism. METHODS: Spectrophotometric analysis, enzyme immunoassay,  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western immunoblotting were used. HO was  enhanced with hemin or inhibited with chromium-mesoporphyrin (CrMP). RESULTS:  Hemin suppressed inflammation by abating proinflammatory macro phage M1 phenotype  (ED1) and chemokines such as macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and  macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) while enhancing  anti-inflammatory macrophage M2 phenotype by potentiating ED2, CD206, and CD14.  Similarly, hemin improved insulin signaling by enhancing insulin receptor  substrate 1 (IRS-1), IRS-2, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), and glucose  transporter 4 (GLUT4) but reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides. These  effects were accompanied by increased HO-1, HO activity, and cyclic guanosine  monophosphate (cGMP), whereas the HO inhibitor CrMP nullified the hemin effects.   Importantly, the effects of the HO system on ED1, ED2, CD206, and CD14 in SHRs  are novel. CONCLUSIONS: Hemin abated inflammation in SHRs by selectively  enhancing the anti-inflammatory macrophage M2 phenotype that dampens inflammation  while suppressing the pronflammatory macrophage M1 phenotype and related  chemokines such as MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha. Importantly, the reduction of  inflammation, total cholesterol, and triglycerides was accompanied by the  enhancement of important proteins implicated in insulin signaling, including  IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3K, and GLUT4. Thus, the concomitant reduction of inflammation,  total cholesterol and triglycerides and the corresponding potentiation of insulin  signaling are among the multifaceted mechanisms by which the HO system improves  glucose metabolism in essential hypertension."|"ho,inflammation,hemin,insulin,macrophage"|"ho,macrophage,inflammation,phenotype,hemin" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Chlamydia pneumoniae,  herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and Helicobacter pylori may contribute to  essential hypertension. However, the evidence now available does not clarify  whether the aggregate number of pathogens (pathogen burden) may be associated  with hypertension. METHODS: Sera from 1,754 men and women aged >/=25 years were  analyzed for immunoglobulin G antibodies to C. pneumoniae, HSV-1, H. pylori, and   CMV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The aggregate number of  seropositives to the studied viral and bacterial agents was defined as pathogen  burden. Hypertension was defined according to World Health Organization criteria.  RESULTS: A total of 459 (26.3%) of the subjects had hypertension. In the  hypertensive group, 4.2% had 0 or 1 pathogens present, 20.6% had 2, 43.2% had 3,   and 32.1% had 4; in the normotensive group, 7.9% had 0 or 1, 28.4% had 2, 42.7%  had 3, and 21.0% had 4. Of the 4 studied pathogens, H. pylori seropositivity  showed a significant independent association with hypertension (odds ratio (OR)  =1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.05-1.79; P = 0.02). In multiple logistic  regression analyses, the pathogen burden did not show a significant independent  association with hypertension. Coinfection with H. pylori and C. pneumoniae was  significantly associated with hypertension compared with double seronegativity  after adjustment for age, sex, chronic low-grade inflammation, and cardiovascular  risk factors (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.14-2.47; P = 0.008]. CONCLUSIONS: The  pathogen burden was not associated with hypertension. However, coinfection with  C. pneumoniae and H. pylori showed a significant association with essential  hypertension, independent of cardiovascular risk factors and chronic low-grade  inflammation."|"hypertension,pylori,pathogen,burden,pneumoniae"|"hypertension,pylori,burden,pathogen,pneumoniae" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary 18-hydroxycortisol has been investigated as a marker of  aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). The aim of this study was to develop and  validate a method for the measurement of 18-hydroxycortisol using liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). METHODS: Urine was collected   over a 24-hour period in patients with APA (n = 11), idiopathic  hyperaldosteronism (IHA, n = 9), and essential hypertension (EH, n = 6).  18-Hydroxycortisol was extracted in solid-phase, and measured by LC-MS/MS based  on selected reaction monitoring. RESULTS: The method allowed quantification of  18-hydroxycortisol with a lower quantification limit of 0.26 nmol/L, intra- and  inter-assay coefficients of variation of <3.4% and a range of analytical recovery  of 98.0-103.7%. Urinary 18-hydroxycortisol excretion for APA, IHA and EH were  determined as 725 (SD 451), 102 (SD 68) and 88 (SD 76) nmol/day, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method met the basic analytical requirements and was  considered to be useful in the screening and differential diagnosis of APA."|"hydroxycortisol,apa,method,ms,analytical"|"18,hydroxycortisol,apa,ms,method" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of hypertension, once-daily administration of  long-acting antihypertensive drugs has been recommended for the improvement of  treatment adherence; however, it is unclear whether dividing daily doses has the   additional benefit of more ideal blood pressure (BP) control over a 24-hour  period. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate whether dividing a  10-mg daily dose of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, is  associated with increased trough plasma amlodipine concentrations, reduced  arterial stiffness, and improved BP control over a 24-hour period. METHODS:  Outpatients with essential hypertension were included this open-label, 2-period  crossover study. The patients were administered amlodipine 10 mg/d in 2 divided  doses for 8 weeks. At week 4, blood was collected just before amlodipine  administration for the evaluation of trough plasma amlodipine concentrations. At   week 8, 24-hour, daytime, nighttime, and early morning BP, as well as arterial  stiffness, were measured using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and cardio-ankle  vascular index (CAVI), respectively. In the subsequent study period, amlodipine  10 mg/d was administered once daily, and the same tests were performed at the  same timings as in period 1. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled (7 men, 3 women;  mean age, 61.0 [15.3] years). Mean 24-hour BP with twice-daily administration was  not significantly lower than that with once-daily administration (129.7  [7.3]/80.1 [7.9] mm Hg vs 130.5 [11.8]/80.1 [7.9] mm Hg, respectively).  Similarly, there were no significant differences in daytime, nighttime, or early   morning BP between twice- and once-daily administration. In addition, the  differences in trough plasma amlodipine concentrations (22.37 [7.66] ng/mL vs  20.57 [8.22] ng/mL) and CAVI values (8.2 [1.8] vs 8.5 [1.0]) were not  significantly different between twice- and once-daily administration.  CONCLUSIONS: Administering amlodipine in 2 divided doses was not associated with   increased trough plasma amlodipine concentrations, reduced arterial stiffness, or  improved BP control over a 24-hour period in patients with essential  hypertension."|"daily,amlodipine,bp,period,administration"|"amlodipine,daily,bp,administration,period" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Fimasartan, a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, was  approved in Korea for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate  hypertension. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 24-hour blood   pressure (BP) profiles before and after 8-week treatment with fimasartan and to  compare them with those of valsartan. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,  double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted using  ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Korean patients with mild to moderate essential   hypertension were enrolled and randomly received once-daily oral fimasartan 60 or  120 mg or valsartan 80 mg for 8 weeks. ABPM was performed before and after 8-week  treatment, and clinic BP was also measured. Based on ABPM data, trough-to-peak  ratio and smoothness index were derived. Tolerability was monitored throughout  the study. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 54.1 [8.2]   years; weight, 67.9 [10.2] kg). After 8 weeks, 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime  mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic BPs (SBP and DBP, respectively) were  significantly decreased in all 3 treatment groups (range: SBP, -9.2 to -15.6 mm  Hg; DBP, -5.0 to -10.7 mm Hg; P <0.0001-<0.05). The global trough-to-peak ratios   of ambulatory DBP in the fimasartan groups were 0.74 (60 mg/d) and 0.81 (120  mg/d)--45.1% and 58.8% higher, respectively, than the ratio of 0.51 in the  valsartan group. Fimasartan 60 mg/d was associated with 53.5% (SBP) and 68.3%  (DBP) greater smoothness index scores compared with those with valsartan 80 mg/d   (SBP, 1.52 vs. 0.99; DBP, 1.38 vs. 0.82). The decrease in clinic-measured DBP was  significantly greater in the fimasartan 60-mg/d group compared with that in the  valsartan 80-mg/d group (-14.0 vs -8.7 mm Hg; P = 0.0380). Fimasartan was well  tolerated; headache was the most common adverse event. CONCLUSION: Once-daily  fimasartan effectively maintained a BP-reduction profile over the full 24-hour  dosing interval; this profile was comparable to or slightly better than that of  once-daily valsartan. Fimasartan was well tolerated; headache was the most common  adverse event."|"fimasartan,treatment,bp,valsartan,dbp"|"fimasartan,mg,dbp,valsartan,60" 
"AB  - Hypertensive adults demonstrate decreased performance on neurocognitive testing  compared with that of normotensive controls. There is now emerging, preliminary  evidence that children with hypertension also manifest neurocognitive differences  when compared with normotensive controls, findings postulated to potentially  represent early signs of hypertensive target organ damage to the brain. However,   reports in children to date have been limited to database and single-center  studies. We have established an ongoing, prospective, multicenter study of  neurocognition in children with primary hypertension. This article outlines the  study methods, with particular attention to the unique challenges in this area of  clinical research. We highlight aspects of the study design that are specifically  designed as solutions to these challenges."|"study,children,hypertension,neurocognitive,hypertensive"|"children,study,challenges,compared,controls" 
"AB  - Recent studies indicate that the pro-inflammatory action of aldosterone (ALDO) or  the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors contribute to the increased risk of  cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the  grade of the inflammatory activation, in relation to ALDO levels, in a large  cohort of essential hypertensive patients. The study included 3770 consecutive  essential hypertensive patients who attended our outpatient clinics. Patients  were evaluated with medical history, repeated office blood pressure and 24-h  ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), physical examination and full  laboratory assessment including ALDO in 24-h urine collection, plasma renin  activity (PRA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), total fibrinogen,  serum homocysteine (Hcy), serum amyloid A (SAA) and white blood cells (WBC)  measurements in morning blood samples. Patients were divided according to PRA  (high PRA >1 ng ml(-1) h(-1), low PRA <1 ng ml(-1) h(-1)) and ALDO levels (high  ALDO >12 but <24 mug per 24 h, low ALDO <12 mug per 24 h) in four groups. The  hsCRP (P<0.022) and SAA (P<0.001) levels increased in parallel with the ALDO  metabolism. Similar differences were observed for Hcy (P<0.001), fibrinogen  (P=0.001) and WBC (P<0.02). High ALDO levels within normal range are related to  the presence of subclinical inflammation in essential hypertension. These data  indicate that ALDO and PRA influence the process of subclinical inflammation  involved in the increased risk of CVD."|"aldo,pra,blood,patients,levels"|"aldo,24,pra,blood,high" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Renin is a rate-limiting enzyme of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone   system (RAAS) that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure. The   renin gene has been suggested as a marker for genetic predisposition to essential  hypertension (EHT) in humans. The purpose of the study is to explore the  association of a genetic marker of renin gene Mbo I polymorphism with EHT in the   South Indian population. METHODS: A total of 279 hypertensive and 200  normotensive subjects were genotyped for REN Mbo I polymorphism (RFLP) using the   PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: There were no  significant differences in the distribution of genotypes and alleles for REN gene  Mbo I polymorphism between hypertensive cases and controls (p>0.05). The  genotypic and allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium both in cases  and controls. Females with Mbo I AA+GA genotypes had 1.87-fold higher risk to  develop hypertension as compared with those with GG genotype (odds ratio 1.87;  95% confidence interval = 0.98-3.56, p = 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: Our results  indicate that renin gene Mbo I site polymorphism is not associated with blood  pressure levels and risk of hypertension. However, the present study demonstrates  risk for females who are carriers of REN Mbo I A allele for developing essential   hypertension."|"mbo,polymorphism,renin,hypertension,gene"|"mbo,polymorphism,renin,gene,hypertension" 
"AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) gene encodes a membrane protein  that acts on angiotensin II (Ang II) and kallikrein to release vasoactive  peptides. The chymase (CMA1) gene is important for Ang II generation. Therefore,   the two genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension  (EH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  the PRCP gene and four tag SNPs and G-1903A (rs1800875) polymorphism in the CMA1   gene were genotyped in the Chinese Han population (n=1020) using a polymerase  chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: In the  PRCP gene, single site analyses indicated that the rs7104980 G allele was a  susceptible factor for EH (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.98, 95% confidence interval  (CI) 1.62-2.43, p=0.3x10(-10)). The protective effect of Hap3 GAGCACTAACA was  observed without carrying the susceptible rs7104908 G allele (OR=0.67, 95% CI  0.56-0.81, p=0.3x10(-4)) by haplotype analyses. In the case of the CMA1 gene, no   associations with EH were found through single site analyses. However, haplotype   analyses showed that Hap16 TTTA significantly increased the risk of EH with  OR=3.15 (p=0.0002) which may be driven by interaction with a nearby SNP  combination. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicated PRCP rs7104980 can be  considered as a marker for EH and Hap3 GAGCACTAACA (PRCP) and Hap16 TTTA (CMA1)  might be associated with EH in Chinese Han population."|"eh,gene,prcp,cma1,analyses"|"eh,gene,prcp,analyses,cma1" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of aranidipine enteric-coated capsules on 24 h   blood pressure and blood pressure variability (BPV) in patients with mild to  moderate essential hypertension. METHODS: This was an open clinical trial with 2   weeks of placebo run-in period. A total of 74 patients with blood pressure  (140-180/95-110 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) were treated by aranidipine (5 mg/d)   for 4 weeks.If clinical sitting blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg at 4th week,  aranidipine at 5 mg/d would be continued for another 8 weeks.If not, the dosage  would be increased to 10 mg/d.If blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg at 8th week,  aranidipine at 5 mg/d or 10 mg/d would be given constantly.If not, the dosage  would be increased to 20 mg/d and given for another 4 weeks. All patients  performed 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) before and after the  treatment with BPV evaluated by the average 24 h per unit time blood pressure  standard deviation and morning blood pressure surge (MBPS). RESULTS: (1) After 12  weeks' treatment with aranidipine, the mean 24 h blood pressure was reduced  significantly compared with the baseline [(14 +/- 13)/(11 +/- 9) mm Hg, both P <   0.05] with trough/peak (T/P) ratio of SBP and DBP in responders of 75.31% and  78.15%, respectively.(2) After 12 weeks' treatment, standard deviations of 24 h,   daytime SBP/DBP and nighttime SBP/DBP were reduced significantly[(25 +/- 3)/(14  +/- 4) mm Hg vs (11 +/- 3)/(8 +/- 2) mm Hg, (24 +/- 5)/(14 +/- 4) mm Hg vs (11  +/- 3)/(8 +/- 2) mm Hg, (10 +/- 3)/(8 +/- 4) mm Hg vs (8 +/- 3)/(6 +/- 3) mm Hg],  respectively with all P < 0.05.Significant decrease was shown in MBPS compared to  the baseline [(27 +/- 11) mm Hg vs (19 +/- 9) mm Hg, P < 0.05]. (3) The incidence  of adverse events was 13.4%, including mild dizziness, flushing and palpitation.   CONCLUSION: Administration of aranidipine enteric-coated capsules can control 24   h blood pressure effectively and reduce BPV significantly in patients with mild  to moderate essential hypertension with good safety profile."|"blood,pressure,weeks,aranidipine,hg"|"hg,mm,blood,pressure,24" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between CYP11B2 gene polymorphism and  essential hypertension, blood pressure level in Chinese Han population by  meta-analysis. METHODS: After searching database, the research quality was  quantified according to NOS. Genetic model, heterogeneity, publication bias,  overall OR/standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI were explored by Stata,  19 studies including 9249 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS:   Compared to control group, OR(95%CI) of CC vs. TT, CT vs. TT, CC vs. CT in  essential hypertensive patients were 1.022(95%CI: 0.879-1.190), 1.108 (95%CI:  0.951-1.291), 1.050(95%CI:0.995-1.109), respectively; SMD (95%CI) was 0.315  (0.066-0.565, P < 0.05) for systolic pressure derived CC vs. TT, and 0.088  (0.014-0.162, P < 0.05) for CT vs. TT CONCLUSION: Individuals with -344C CYP11B2   allele are at higher risk of increased systolic blood pressure, but there is no  evidence showing association between CYP11B2 polymorphism and susceptibility of  essential hypertension in Chinese Han population."|"ci,cyp11b2,pressure,essential,blood"|"95,ci,vs,tt,cc" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Increasing experimental evidence indicates that alterations in the  extracellular matrix are implicated in hypertension and its chronic  complications. Selected markers of extracellular matrix metabolism were  investigated as potential biomarkers for hypertensive remodelling and correlated   with the severity and extent of target organ damage (TOD) in patients with  essential hypertension. METHODS: We studied 159 consecutive patients being  treated for essential hypertension. An exhaustive evaluation of the heart, kidney  and blood vessel damage was performed, and plasma levels of plasma procollagen  type I (PICP), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and its inhibitor (tissue  inhibitor metalloproteinase-1, TIMP-1) were determined. Patients were categorized  into four groups: no TOD (33 patients), level 1 TOD (52 patients), level 2 TOD  (44 patients) and level 3 TOD (30 patients). RESULTS: The serum levels of MMP-1  and TIMP-1 were higher in patients with TOD than in hypertensive patients without  TOD. Increasing levels of these molecules were progressively associated with an  increase in the number of organs damaged, with highest levels of markers in  patients with level 3 TOD (heart, kidney and blood vessels). There were no  differences in PICP levels between groups. We found a slight but significant  correlation between TIMP-1 and all hypertensive organ damage. Logistic regression  analysis showed that age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, abdominal perimeter, MMP-1   and TIMP-1 were independently related to the level of TOD. CONCLUSION:  Circulating concentration of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 is associated with an extended  hypertensive disease, with more TOD. TIMP-1 may have a role as a biomarker of  total remodelling burden in hypertensive patients."|"tod,timp,patients,levels,hypertensive"|"patients,tod,timp,hypertensive,level" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between blood pressure variability  (BPV) and left ventricular diastolic function in patients with essential  hypertension. METHODS: Left ventricular diastolic function of 252 hypertensive  patients were assessed by early (E) diastolic transmitral flows to early  diastolic mitral annular velocity (Ea) (E/Ea) ratio derived from Doppler  echocardiography. Patients were divided into two groups according to normal left   ventricular diastolic function group (E/Ea<15, n = 168) and left ventricular  diastolic dysfunction group (E/Ea >/= 15, n = 84). All patients were monitored by  ambulatory blood pressure. Standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation  (CV) of blood pressure were calculated as the BPV. Relationship between BPV and  left ventricular diastolic function were analyzed by multivariate logistic  regression analysis. RESULTS: All-day average diastolic blood pressure(DBP), the   day systolic blood pressure (SBP), night SBP, night DBP, SBPSD, DBPSD and DBPCV  in the left ventricular diastolic dysfunction group were significantly higher  than in the normal diastolic function group (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic  regression analysis showed that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was  associated with SBPSD (OR:1.126, 95%CI:1.054-1.203, P < 0.01), SBPCV (OR:1.127,  95%CI:1.036-1.225, P < 0.01) in this patient cohort. CONCLUSION: High variability  of SBP is correlated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive   patients."|"diastolic,left,ventricular,blood,pressure"|"diastolic,left,ventricular,blood,function" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The rs41318021 polymorphism in the SLC7A1 gene affects endothelial NO  production through changes in L-arginine transport. This variation could thus  hypothetically cause dysfunction of endothelium and lead to hypertension. The  association of rs41318021 with hypertension was therefore studied in a Finnish  cohort. METHODS: A total of 412 hypertensive cases and 771 non-hypertensive  controls from a Finnish 50-year-old cohort were included in this study. The data   was collected from the Tampere adult population cardiovascular risk study  (TAMRISK). DNA was extracted from buccal swabs and amplified using PCR. A  subpopulation of men and women who had available follow-up data of blood pressure  measurements at the age of 35-, 40-, 45- and 50 years was also analyzed. RESULTS:  There was no difference between the variant frequencies of the hypertension group  and normotensive group at the age of 50 years (p = 0.209). However, repeated  measures analysis from the 15-year follow-up showed that subjects having gene  variants CT or TT had slightly higher diastolic blood pressure than subjects  having genotype CC (p = 0.047). By post-hoc analysis, this was most pronounced at  the age of 35 years (p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: The rs41318021 polymorphism in the  SLC7A1 gene was not associated with essential hypertension in 50-year-old  subjects. However, a borderline effect of this variation upon diastolic blood  pressure was seen in these same subjects in a 15-year follow-up from a  35-year-old cohort to 50 years of age."|"hypertension,year,gene,subjects,years"|"50,year,age,hypertension,subjects" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The Effects of Aerobic Exercise Training (AET) on self-reported  Quality of Life (QoL) in people with hypertension have been previously  documented. However, data on black populations, especially from Africa, seem not   to be available. This study investigated the effects of AET on QoL and exercise  capacity in Nigerians on treatment for essential hypertension. METHOD: This  randomised-controlled trial involved newly diagnosed individuals, with  mild-to-moderate essential hypertension randomly assigned to antihypertensive  drugs (ADs) alone (control: n = 60) and AET+ADs (exercise: n = 60) groups. The  study lasted for 12 weeks. QoL was measured using the World Health Organization  QoL Short Form (WHOQoL-BREF) and exercise capacity was assessed using the  Rockport Fitness Walk Test pre- and post-study. RESULTS: Physical health,  psychological health, and social relationships domains of QoL improved  significantly in the exercise and control groups post-intervention. The  environment domain of QoL and exercise capacity improved significantly in only  the exercise group. There were larger improvements in the physical health,  psychological health, and environment domains of QoL, and exercise capacity in  the exercise group. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise improves QoL and exercise  capacity in individuals with essential hypertension."|"qol,exercise,capacity,hypertension,health"|"exercise,qol,capacity,health,hypertension" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in primary  aldosteronism (PA) is higher than in essential hypertension. LVH is an  independent cardiovascular risk factor. Treatment of PA with mineralocorticoid  receptor blockers (MRBs) improves LVH. Previous studies included relatively small  groups, low incidence of LVH and used high MRB dose. We tested the hypothesis  that long-term regression of LVH in PA/low-renin hypertension may be achieved  with low-dose MRB. METHODS: Forty-eight patients (male/female 28/20, age 61.4  years, range 47-84) had PA (low renin, high aldosterone and high  aldosterone/renin ratio, n=24) or low-renin hypertension (low renin, normal  aldosterone and high aldosterone/renin ratio, n=24). All had either LVH or  concentric remodelling. All had an echocardiogram both at baseline and at 1 year   after the initiation of spironolactone. A subgroup of 29 patients had an  echocardiogram at baseline, 1 year (range 0.5-1.5) and 3 years (range 1.8-7).  RESULTS: At baseline, spironolactone was commenced in all patients. The dose was   33.3+/-13.7 and 29.0+/-11.7 mg/day at 1 year and 3 years, respectively. A total  of 73% of the patients received </=37.5 mg/day. Introduction of spironolactone  enabled the reduction of other antihypertensive medications (from 2.6+/-1.2 to  1.5+/-1.0 at 1 year). At 1 year, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased   (149.3+/-14.1 to 126.2+/-12.0 mmHg, P<0.001, and 88.2+/-9.8 to 78.3+/-7.1 mmHg,  P<0.001, respectively). At baseline, LVH was present in 39 of the 48 (81%)  patients, and concentric remodelling, i.e. increased relative wall thickness  (RWT) with a normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI), in 36 (75%). At 1 year,  LVMI decreased in 44 of the 48 (92%) patients (142.9+/-25.4 versus 117.7+/-20.4  g/m2, P<0.001). LVH normalized in 16 of the 39 (41%) patients. RWT normalized in   36% of the patients. The changes in blood pressure and LVMI did not correlate. At  3 years, LVH decreased further and normalized in 57% of the patients.  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PA/low-renin hypertension, long-term regression of   LVH may be achieved with low-dose MRB."|"lvh,patients,pa,low,year"|"lvh,patients,low,renin,year" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: In recent years, the metabolic syndrome represents a major health  problem worldwide, with a great impact in population, and also at individual  level, by an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  We conducted a descriptive study on a lot of 131 patients hospitalized in  Cardiovascular Clinic of Rehabilitation Hospital in Iasi, in the period April  2012 - April 2013. RESULTS: In the analyzed group, the largest number of  metabolic syndrome cases was recorded in the 50-59 years age group. There were no  significant differences between the rural / urban areas (t = 0.113, p = 0.910).  Frequency of ischemia was significantly higher in subjects with essential  hypertension of IInd and IIIrd degree (Pearson Chi-square test = 3.955, df = 1, p  <0.05). Significant differences were observed on females related to obesity and  ischemia, meaning that women with higher obesity are predisposed to ischemic  events. Regarding the degree of exercise testing and the origin area, no  significant differences were registered (Pearson Chi-square test = 13.526, p =  0.004, df= 3). CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers new information on metabolic  syndrome, analyzing epidemiological and clinical criteria."|"syndrome,metabolic,significant,differences,cardiovascular"|"differences,metabolic,significant,syndrome,april" 
"AB  - UNLABELLED: IASI, DURING OCTOBER 2010-JULY 201The arterial hypertension of the  elderly represents an important public health issue, with an ever increasing  tendency, due to the population ageing process. AIM: The aim of this research is   to contribute new data related to the incidence of essential hypertension in  elderly patients with metabolic syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study  was conducted on a number of 1,832 patients hospitalized in the Cardiovascular  Rehabilitation Clinic of Rehabilitation Hospital Iasi, in the period October  2010-July 2012. Of these patients we selected the ones who were 65 years of age  or more and who fulfilled at least three of the five criteria that define the  metabolic syndrome, using the criteria recommended by AHA/NHLBI. RESULTS: The  data obtained revealed an increased incidence of the cardiometabolic syndrome in   patients over 65 years of age, in a percentage of 73%. The gender repartition  revealed a higher frequency in the case of female patients (66%). Of the  metabolic syndrome criteria, the highest incidence was registered for the  essential hypertension. Most of the hypertensive patients were diagnosed with  essential hypertension grade 3 (55%), while the rest had grade 2 (29%) and grade   1 respectively (16%). CONCLUSION: EHT has a significant occurrence in elderly  patients. It seems that hypertension of the elderly has a higher occurrence in  the case of female patients, due to the lack of hormonal protection. The  association with the other risk factors related to the metabolic syndrome makes  the elderly more prone to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular  diseases."|"patients,syndrome,elderly,hypertension,metabolic"|"patients,elderly,hypertension,syndrome,metabolic" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence on the impact of interventions   to improve medication adherence in adults prescribed antihypertensive  medications. METHODS: An electronic search was undertaken of articles published  between 1979 and 2009, without language restriction, that focused on  interventions to improve antihypertensive medication adherence among patients  (>/=18 years) with essential hypertension. Studies must have measured adherence  as an outcome of the intervention. We followed standard guidelines for the  conduct and reporting of the review and conducted a narrative synthesis of  reported data. RESULTS: Ninety-seven articles were identified for inclusion; 35  (35 of 97, 36.1%) examined interventions to directly improve medication  adherence, and the majority (58 of 97, 59.8%) were randomized controlled trials.   Thirty-four (34 of 97, 35.1%) studies reported a statistically significant  improvement in medication adherence. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aimed   at improving patients' knowledge of medications possess the greatest potential  clinical value in improving adherence with antihypertensive therapy. However, we   identified several limitations of these studies, and advise future researchers to  focus on using validated adherence measures, well-designed randomized controlled   trials with relevant adherence and clinical outcomes, and guidelines on the  appropriate design and analysis of adherence research."|"adherence,interventions,studies,medication,antihypertensive"|"adherence,interventions,medication,35,97" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, urinary aldosterone level measurement was a commonly  employed confirmatory test to detect primary aldosteronism (PA). However, 24-h  urine collection is inconvenient and cumbersome. We hypothesized that random  urinary aldosterone measurements with correction for creatinine concentration  might be comparable to 24-h urinary aldosterone levels (Uald-24 h) in the  diagnosis of PA. METHODS: The non-concurrent prospective study was conducted  between June 2006 and March 2008 in patients admitted for confirmation of  aldosteronism by salt loading test. A 24-h urine sample, which was collected  during hospitalization on the day before saline infusion testing after  restoration of serum hypokalemia, was collected from all subjects. Moreover,  participants were asked to collect a first bladder voiding random urine sample  during clinic visits. Uald-24 h and the random urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine   ratio (UACR) were calculated accordingly. RESULTS: A total of 102 PA patients (71  patients diagnosed of aldosterone-producing adenoma, 31 with idiopathic  hyperaldosteronism) and 65 patients with EH were enrolled. The receiver operating  characteristic curve showed comparable areas under the curves of UACR and Uald-24  h. The Bland-Altman plot showed mean bias but no obvious heteroscedasticity  between the two tests. When using random UACR >3.0 ng/mg creatinine as the cutoff  value, we obtained a specificity of 90.6% to confirm PA from essential  hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforce that the diagnostic accuracy of  random UACR was comparable to that of Uald-24 h in PA patients. With the  quickness and simplicity of the UACR method and its equivalence to Uald-24 h,  this assay could be a good alternative diagnostic tool for PA confirmation."|"pa,random,uacr,aldosterone,patients"|"24,pa,aldosterone,patients,random" 
"AB  - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a key role in regulating blood  pressure by maintaining vascular tone and the water/sodium balance. Many  antihypertensive drugs target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but the  effect differs considerably among hypertensive patients. We investigated whether   genetic variants of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor are associated with blood   pressure response to angiotensin II receptor blockers in hypertensive Chinese  patients. After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, 148 patients with  mild-to-moderate primary hypertension received monotherapy with 80 mg/day  telmisartan and then were followed up for 8 weeks. The 1166A/C, 573T/C, -810A/T,   and -521C/T polymorphisms of the AT1R gene were determined through PCR and RFLP  analysis. The relationship between these polymorphisms and changes in blood  pressure was observed and evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment. Patients with the  AT1R -521CC genotype had a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure  compared to those carrying the T allele. No significant reduction in blood  pressure was found in individuals with the 1166A/C, 573T/C, or -810A/T  polymorphisms of the AT1R gene. We conclude that only the AT1R -521CC genotype is  associated with a significant decrease in blood pressure in response to  telmisartan treatment in Chinese hypertensive patients."|"pressure,blood,patients,angiotensin,hypertensive"|"blood,pressure,patients,angiotensin,at1r" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Autonomic imbalance, characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity and  diminished vagal tone, is a known mechanism for essential hypertension.  Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) demonstrates beneficial outcomes in a number of  cardiovascular populations, which may potentially extend to patients with  hypertension. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the effects of IMT  on blood pressure and autonomic cardiovascular control in patients with essential  hypertension. METHODS: Thirteen patients with hypertension were randomly assigned  to an eight-week IMT program (6 patients) or to a placebo-IMT (P-IMT, 7 patients)  protocol. We recorded RR interval for posterior analysis of heart rate  variability and blood pressure, by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),  before and after the program. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in  inspiratory muscle strength in the IMT group (82.7 +/- 28.8 vs 121.5 +/- 21.8  cmH2O, P<0.001), which was not demonstrated by P-IMT (93.3 +/- 25.3 vs 106.1 +/-   25.3 cmH2O, P>0.05). There was also a reduction in 24-hour measurement of  systolic (133.2 +/- 9.9 vs 125.2 +/- 13.0 mm Hg, P=0.02) and diastolic (80.7 +/-   12.3 vs 75.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, P=0.02) blood pressure, as well as in daytime  systolic (136.8 +/- 12.2 vs 127.6 +/- 14.2 mm Hg, P=0.008) and diastolic (83.3  +/- 13.1 vs. 77.2 +/- 12.2 mm Hg, P =0.01) blood pressure in the IMT group. In  relation to autonomic cardiovascular control, we found increased parasympathetic   modulation (HF: 75.5 +/- 14.6 vs. 84.74 +/- 7.55 n.u, P=0.028) and reduced  sympathetic modulation (LF: 34.67 +/- 20.38 vs. 12.81 +/- 6.68 n.u; P=0.005).  Moreover, there was reduction of cardiac sympathetic discharge (fLF) in IMT group  (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: IMT demonstrates beneficial effects on systolic and  diastolic blood pressure as well as autonomic cardiovascular control in  hypertensive patients."|"imt,patients,blood,pressure,cardiovascular"|"imt,vs,blood,patients,pressure" 
"AB  - The present study was planned to access the role of oxidative stress and  anti-oxidant status in essential hypertension. Malondialdehyde is one of the  by-products of lipid peroxidase and so extent of lipid peroxidation was measured   by estimating malondialdehyde levels, nitrite concentration was used as an index   of nitric oxide synthesis and anti-oxidant status was measured in terms of total   antioxidant capacity. One hundred and eighty cases with essential hypertension  and 60 volunteers as healthy controls were selected for the study. The subjects  under study were grouped as pregeriatric (35-50 years) and geriatric (51-65  years). These cases were further subdivided into group I (mild), group II  (moderate) and group III (severe), depending upon the levels of blood pressure.  The study results showed statistically significant increased levels of serum  malondialdehyde in all the groups of essential hypertensive patients when  compared to that of healthy controls (p < 0.001), whereas levels of serum nitric   oxide and total anti-oxidant capacity were significantly decreased in all groups   of essential hypertensive patients when compared to those of controls (p <  0.001). These clear findings of the present study focuses the attention towards  an alteration in the status of oxidants and anti-oxidant parameters indicating an  impact of free radical action in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension."|"levels,study,essential,anti,oxidant"|"essential,study,anti,levels,oxidant"

"AB  - BACKGROUND: Blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in patients with  chronic kidney disease (CKD) improves surrogate cardiovascular outcomes, such as   left ventricular mass. Animal models of renal disease support a pathological role  of mineralocorticoids, in the context of a high sodium intake. We aimed to assess  the regulation of mineralocorticoid biosynthesis in patients with CKD. METHODS:  Seventy patients with CKD stages 3/4 and 30 patients with essential hypertension   (EH) were recruited. Patients underwent detailed clinical phenotyping, drug  history and biochemical assessment. Patients completed a 24-h urine collection  for measurement of urinary tetrahydroaldosterone (THALDO) and  tetrahydrocorticosterone (THDOC) excretion rates (measured using gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry) and urinary electrolytes. The factors which  correlated significantly with THALDO and THDOC excretion were entered into linear  regression models. RESULTS: Patients with EH and CKD were well matched with no  significant differences in gender, age or weight. The mean estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR) in CKD patients was 38.6/min/1.73 m(2). The mean urinary  excretion rates of THALDO, THDOC and 24-h urinary sodium (24-h USod) were not  significantly different between CKD and EH patients. The level of renal function   did not correlate with THALDO or THDOC excretion. In patients with CKD, 24-h  USodium (r = 0.614, P < 0.001) and 24-h UPotassium (r = 0.538, P < 0.001) were  positively correlated with THALDO excretion. On multivariate linear regression  analysis, 24-h USod was the strongest independent predictor (P = 0.004) of THALDO  and THDOC excretion in CKD. In patients with EH, no relationship was seen between  mineralocorticoid excretion and 24-h urinary sodium excretion. CONCLUSIONS: In  patients with CKD, 24-h urinary sodium excretion is the strongest positive  predictor of urinary mineralocorticoid excretion. The nature of this relationship  is unexpected, novel, not seen in patients with EH and may explain the  association seen between high urinary sodium excretion, mineralocorticoids and  poor outcomes in patients with CKD."|"patients,ckd,excretion,urinary,thaldo"|"patients,excretion,ckd,24,urinary" 
"AB  - AIM: To explore the role of the ACE gene polymorphisms in the risk of essential  hypertension in Mexican Mestizo individuals and evaluate the correlation between   these polymorphisms and the serum ACE levels. METHODS: Nine ACE gene  polymorphisms were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays and  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 239 hypertensive and 371 non- hypertensive  Mexican individuals. Haplotypes were constructed after linkage disequilibrium  analysis. ACE serum levels were determined in selected individuals according to  different haplotypes. RESULTS: Under a dominant model, rs4291 rs4335, rs4344,  rs4353, rs4362, and rs4363 polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk  of hypertension after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, triglycerides, alcohol  consumption, and smoking. Five polymorphisms (rs4335, rs4344, rs4353, rs4362 and   rs4363) were in strong linkage disequilibrium and were included in four  haplotypes: H1 (AAGCA), H2 (GGATG), H3 (AGATG), and H4 (AGACA). Haplotype H1 was   associated with decreased risk of hypertension, while haplotype H2 was associated  with an increased risk of hypertension (OR = 0.77, P = 0.023 and OR = 1.41, P =  0.004 respectively). According to the codominant model, the H2/H2 and H1/H2  haplotype combinations were significantly associated with risk of hypertension  after adjusted by age, gender, BMI, triglycerides, alcohol consumption, and  smoking (OR = 2.0; P = 0.002 and OR = 2.09; P = 0.011, respectively). Significant  elevations in serum ACE concentrations were found in individuals with the H2  haplotype (H2/H2 and H2/H1) as compared to H1/H1 individuals (P = 0.0048).  CONCLUSION: The results suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms and the  "GGATG" haplotype of the ACE gene are associated with the development of  hypertension and with increased ACE enzyme levels."|"polymorphisms,ace,individuals,h2,h1"|"h2,ace,h1,hypertension,polymorphisms" 
"AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear  receptor involved in the regulation of several biochemical pathways. Blood  pressure-lowering effects have been found in PPARgamma agonists in several  hypertensive models. The biology and research data related to the gene suggest  that it could play a role in essential hypertension (EH) susceptibility. This  study aimed to investigate the association between PPARgamma polymorphisms and  EH. About 820 subjects were genotyped for the three single-nucleotide  polymorphisms used as genetic markers for the PPARgamma genes (C681G, Prol2Ala,  and C1431T). After correction for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, body  mass index, waist circumference, and fasting glucose, the G allele (CG+GG) of  C681G was significantly associated with the increase in the risk of EH (odds  ratio [OR]=1.54, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-2.09, p=0.005). The A allele  (PA+PP) of Pro12Ala was significantly associated with the decrease in the risk of  EH (OR=0.70, 95%CI: 0.52-0.95, p=0.020). However, C1431T was not significantly  associated with EH. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis  showed that there was a potential gene-gene interaction between C681G and  Prol2Ala (p=0.0107). The G-P haplotype (established by C681G, Prol2Ala) was  significantly associated with increase in the risk of EH (OR=1.53,  95%CI:1.13-2.07, p=0.006). In conclusion, PPARgamma polymorphisms and haplotypes   were significantly associated with hypertension susceptibility."|"ppargamma,eh,significantly,associated,c681g"|"eh,associated,ppargamma,significantly,95" 
"AB  - Increased heart rate (HR) is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality in the general population and in some clinical conditions. Endothelial   dysfunction is an adverse prognostic factor for cardiovascular events. The aim of  the study was to evaluate the effect of HR on central hemodynamic parameters and   endothelial function in hypertension. We evaluated forearm blood flow (FBF)  response to intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium  nitroprusside (SNP) in 30 patients with HR </=60 min(-1) and 30 with HR >/=80  min(-1). The FBF was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Transesophageal  atrial pacing was used to increase the HR. Radial artery applanation tonometry  and pulse wave analysis were used to derive central aortic pressures and  correlate hemodynamic indices. The FBF response to ACh is lower in hypertensives   with HR </=60 min(-1) than in those with HR >/=80 min(-1) (10.6 +/- 4.2 vs. 13.6   +/- 5.1 ml x 100 ml(-1) of tissue x min(-1), P < 0.001). Vascular resistance  decreases to 9.3 +/- 2.8 U in patients with lower HR versus 7.2 +/- 2.1 U in  those with higher HR (P = 0.002). The FBF response to SNP is similar in both  groups. Central systolic and pulse pressure are higher in bradycardic patients  than in those with HR >/=80 min(-1) (140 +/- 8 vs. 131 +/- 8 mmHg, P = 0.0001 and  49 +/- 10 vs. 39 +/- 11 mmHg, P = 0.0001). All central hemodynamic parameters  decrease during incremental atrial pacing. Augmentation index is the strongest  predictor of endothelial dysfunction at multivariate analysis. These findings  demonstrate that low HR affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in  hypertension. Increased central aortic pressure and hemodynamic correlates seem  to be the underlying mechanisms by which bradycardia interferes with  endothelium-dependent reactivity."|"hr,central,fbf,hemodynamic,endothelial"|"hr,min,central,fbf,hemodynamic" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of the gene-gene interaction among the single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  alpha/delta/gamma on essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: Participants were  recruited based on the previous work of the PMMJS (Prevention of Multiple  Metabolic Disorders and Metabolic Syndrome in Jiangsu Province) cohort study in  Jiangsu province of China. A total number of 820 subjects were randomly selected   from the cohort and received gene polymorphism detection covered ten  SNPs:PPARalpha/delta/gamma (PPARalpha: rs135539, rs1800206 and rs4253778;  PPARdelta: rs2016520 and rs9794; PPARgamma: rs10865710, rs1805192, rs4684847,  rs709158 and rs3856806). Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR)   model was used to evaluate the association between gene-gene interaction among  the ten SNPs and EH. RESULTS: After adjusting factors as gender, age, BMI, FPG,  TG, HDL-C, high fat diet, low fiber diet and physical activity, results from the   GMDR analysis showed that the best qualitative trait models were 7/9-dimensional   model (EH: cross-validation consistency were 9/10 and 10/10, prediction accuracy   were 0.5862 and 0.5885), 5/9-dimensional model (SBP:cross-validation consistency   were 10/10 and 8/10, prediction accuracy were 0.6055 and 0.6011), and  8/9-dimensional model (DBP: cross-validation consistency both were 10/10,  prediction accuracy were 0.5926 and 0.5972), while the best quantitative trait  models were 4/5-dimensional model (SBP: cross-validation consistency were 10/10  and 8/10, prediction accuracy were 0.6111 and 0.6072), and 5-dimensional model  (DBP: cross-validation consistency were 9/10, prediction accuracy were 0.5753).  CONCLUSION: Interactions among ten SNPs of PPARs seemed to have existed and with   significant impact on the levels of blood pressure."|"snps,gene,eh,model,ten"|"10,model,accuracy,consistency,cross" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio   (UACR) and the diameter of retinal vessel in population with essential  hypertension in Fujian coastal area. METHODS: Central retinal artery and vein  equivalents (CRAE and CRVE) were measured from the avoiding mydriatic digitized  photographs and semi-automatic fundus analysis software, as well as albumin and  urine creatinine. RESULTS: There were significant differences in CRAE levels  among the normal control group, normoalbuminuria with essential hypertension  group and microalbuminuria with essential hypertension group [(135.68 +/- 10.10)   microm, (129.79 +/- 10.48) microm, (125.29 +/- 11.17) microm, all P values <  0.01]. The CRAE levels were significantly negative correlated with UACR (r =  -0.29, P < 0.01). Linear regression analysis showed CRAE was associated with UACR  in the patients with hypertension(beta = -5.0, P < 0.01). Logistic regression  analysis showed, systolic blood pressure (beta = 1.08, P = 0.02) was risk factor   for CRAE abnormality. The CRAE abnormality was increased in turn in the normal  control group, normoalbuminuria with the essential hypertension group and  microalbuminuria with essential hypertension group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The  reduction of central retinal artery diameter are associated with the hypertensive  renal damage. UACR and CRAE could be used to evaluate the microvascular lesions  and be used as an indicator to assess the target organs damage in essential  hypertension patients."|"crae,uacr,hypertension,essential,analysis"|"crae,hypertension,essential,group,01" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate glucose metabolism status and its relationship with  blood pressure, obesity, renal function and cardio-cerebral vascular events in  Chinese essential hypertensive patients. METHODS: Essential hypertensive patients  without diabetic history were enrolled in this cross-sectional survey. All  patients filled in questionnaires and received physical examination and  laboratory tests. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, fasting and 2 hours glucose   level after drinking the 75 g glucose solution) was performed in patients who  signed the informed consent. RESULTS: (1) The control rate of systolic BP was  lower in patients with dysglycemia than in patients without dysglycemia (41.0%  vs. 46.4%, P = 0.000). (2) The albuminuria detection rate and the abnormal rate  of estimated glumerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased significantly with the  deterioration of glucose metabolism. (3) Multifactor-analysis showed that  abnormal waist circumference, decreased eGFR and presence of albuminuria were  independent risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism. Cardiovascular events  was significantly higher in patients with abnormal glucose metabolism than  patients with normal glucose metabolism. CONCLUSION: Abnormal glucose metabolism   is common in Chinese essential hypertensive patients. When complicated with  abnormal glucose metabolism, essential hypertensive patients had poor blood  pressure control rate and were related to higher cardiovascular risk."|"glucose,patients,abnormal,metabolism,rate"|"glucose,patients,metabolism,abnormal,rate" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of L-amlodipine besylate for   blood pressure control in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.   METHOD: A total of 1051 mild to moderate essential hypertensives were recruited  from 22 centers and randomized into three groups and were given low-dose  L-amlodipine besylate (2.5 mg/d), high-dose L-amlodipine besylate (5.0 mg/d), and  amlodipine maleate (5.0 mg/d) on the principle of open-label and parallel  control. The study drugs were administered for 8 weeks. RESULTS: After 8 weeks  treatments, the response rate of the three groups were 72.4%, 85.6%, and 76.2%,  respectively. The rate difference between high-dose L-amlodipine besylate group  and the other two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.01), while the  rate difference between low-dose L-amlodipine besylate group and amlodipine  maleate group was similar (P = 0.28). The event rates of the three groups were  similar (4.3%, 4.6%, and 5.1%, respectively, P = 0.84). CONCLUSION: High-dose  L-amlodipine besylate is superior to the other 2 groups on blood pressure  control. The efficacy profiles of amlodipine maleate and low-dose L-amlodipine  besylate are equivalent. Safety profiles of these three groups are comparable."|"amlodipine,groups,besylate,control,three"|"amlodipine,besylate,dose,groups,control" 
"AB  - We investigated a possible association of polymorphism of the eNOS gene and  essential hypertension in the Chinese Hui population; polymorphisms of rs2070744   (T>C), rs1799983 (G>T), rs1800780 (A>G), and rs3918181 (A>G) loci of the eNOS  gene were examined. We found that the genotypic frequencies at rs1799983 and  rs1800780 loci differed significantly between patients with essential  hypertension and control cohorts. The allelic frequency of the rs1799983 locus  also differed significantly between essential hypertension patients and  non-essential hypertension controls in this population. Additionally, the G  allele of the rs1799983 locus was less frequent in the essential hypertension  patients than in controls, with an odds ratio (OR) value of 3.851 [95% confidence  interval (95%CI) = 2.236-6.631]. This is an indication of a protective factor of   essential hypertension in Chinese Hui people. Haplotype analysis using the 4 SNPs  revealed 15 haplotypes. Haplotype frequencies of CGAG, TTAG, TGGG, TTGG, and TTGA  were significantly different in essential hypertension patients compared to  non-essential hypertension controls. Individuals with haplotypes CGAG [chi(2) =  7.371, OR (95%CI) = 0.352 (0.161-0.770)] and TGGG [chi(2) = 6.180, OR (95%CI) =  0.600 (0.400- 0.899)] appear less likely to have essential hypertension. However,  Chinese Hui with the haplotype TTAG are at risk to develop essential hypertension  [chi(2) = 10.816, OR (95%CI) = 2.689 (1.466-4.932)]. We conclude that  polymorphism of the eNOS gene is associated with susceptibility to essential  hypertension in the Chinese Hui population."|"hypertension,essential,rs1799983,enos,gene"|"essential,hypertension,95,chinese,ci" 
"AB  - Increased blood viscosity reduces blood flow and elevates vascular resistance in   the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to elucidate how blood  viscosity could affect renal function and eventually contribute to renal damage  in essential hypertensives (EHT). In 164 untreated EHT without apparent renal  damage (96 men, 56+/-12 years old, creatinine clearance 123+/-33 ml min(-1) per  1.73 m(2) and urinary albumin excretion 19+/-19 mg per day), blood and plasma  viscosity was determined using a falling ball microviscometer. Blood viscosity  correlated negatively with creatinine clearance (r=-0.185, P=0.018) and  positively with urinary albumin excretion (r=0.253, P=0.001). This indicated that  increased blood viscosity is associated with reduced renal function and worsening  of albuminuria in EHT. Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified blood  viscosity as an independent determinant of creatinine clearance (R(2)=0.058) and   urinary albumin excretion (R(2)=0.216). In conclusion, increased blood viscosity   may be a risk for development of renal disease in EHT."|"blood,viscosity,renal,eht,clearance"|"blood,viscosity,renal,eht,albumin" 
"AB  - We describe the case of a 67-year-old female with long-standing essential  hypertension, resistant to treatment with a combination of six different drugs,  referred for catheter-based radiofrequency renal denervation. A radial access was  chosen because the patient was very obese and of short stature. This described  renal denervation through the radial artery might represent an alternative for  patients in whom femoral access is a higher-risk option, such as very obese  patients and patients with peripheral artery disease or with a higher bleeding  risk. Nevertheless, with the current available system, this approach is difficult  and cannot be widely used, not only because of the length but also because of the  stiffness of the catheter."|"artery,access,catheter,obese,patients"|"patients,access,artery,catheter,denervation" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: In the kidney, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) are  formed by the same enzyme, l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, but act on renal   function and glomerular structure in an opposite direction. The present study was  designed to explore whether rates of renal production of 5-HT relative to that of  DA are altered in patients with essential hypertension and microalbuminuria.  METHODS: We measured urinary levels of 5-HT and DA, reflecting renal production  of 5-HT and DA as well as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and urinary albumin  excretion in 82 consecutive untreated, essential hypertensives without overt  proteinuria. RESULTS: Urinary 5-HT excretion and the ratio of urinary 5-HT to DA   were significantly higher in 22 patients with microalbuminuria than in the  remaining patients with normoalbuminuria, although urinary DA levels did not  differ between the groups. The 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures  were also higher in the microalbuminuric group than in the normoalbuminuric  group. Multiple regression analysis revealed that urinary 5-HT excretion and  24-hour systolic blood pressure were independently associated with urinary  albumin excretion. Furthermore, urinary 5-HT excretion was positively correlated   with creatinine clearance as well as blood pressure but tended to be negatively  correlated with fractional excretion of sodium. CONCLUSIONS: Renal production of   5-HT is enhanced compared with that of DA in essential hypertensives with  microalbuminuria. This imbalance may contribute to the genesis of hypertensive  glomerular damage."|"ht,urinary,da,excretion,renal"|"ht,urinary,da,excretion,blood" 
"AB  - The intima-media thickness (IMT) is considered as a surrogate marker for  atherosclerotic disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of  carotid IMT with fetuin-A in patients with essential hypertension (EH) and normal  renal function. The plasma levels of fetuin-A, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the biomarker of oxidative stress  8-iso-PGF2alpha were assayed in samples from 105 untreated EH patients. Carotid  IMT measurements were also performed. EH was studied overall and after dividing  in EH with IMT >/= and <0.9 mm. All of the biomarkers were significantly  different between the two subgroups, in particular, the fetuin-A level was lower   in the patients with an IMT >/=0.9 mm. In the overall group, the linear analysis   of correlation demonstrated that the IMT was significantly inversely correlated  with the fetuin-A level (r=-0.40, P<0.0001) and directly with TNF-alpha (r=0.39,   P<0.0001), IL-6 (r=0.38, P<0.0001) and 8-iso-PGF2alpha (r=0.356, P<0.0003). The  multiple regression analysis performed that assigned IMT as a dependent variable   showed that fetuin-A (beta=-0.268, P<0.0001) was independently correlated with  the IMT. Receiver-operator curves demonstrated that fetuin-A levels have a  predictive power of IMT>0.9 mm (AUC (area under the curve) 0.738, P<0.0001). Our   results suggest that in EH, fetuin-A is associated with the IMT independently of   oxidative stress and renal function, thus predicting increases in the IMT."|"imt,fetuin,eh,mm,stress"|"imt,fetuin,0001,eh,alpha" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of Serine Threonine Kinase-39 A-G polymorphism  rs3592960 in rural population. METHODS: The random, cross-sectional study was  carried out from 2009 to 2010 on 528 subjects in Tharparkar, Pakistan. Data was  recorded excluding cases of secondary hypertension. Normotensives were used as  the controls and hypertensives as the cases. Genotyping was carried out by  tetra-primer amplification refraction mutation system-polymerase chain reaction  method and the data was analysed statistically with SPSS-14. RESULTS: The  association of Serine Threonine Kinase-39 rs35929607 with essential hypertension   was as 3.07 (95% confidence interval 2.10-4.49) units/mmHg per G allele (p =  0.001). Raised systolic BP > 140mmHg showed 0.76 (95% CI, 0.47-1.23) (p = 0.235)   and raised diastolic BP > 90mmHg showed 0.93 (95% CI, 0.61-1.44) units/mmHg per G  allele (p = 0.735). Frequency of the risk allele G was less (33.3%) than that of   allele-A (66.7%), (p = 0.0001). The effect size of genetic factors was  non-significant, beta = 0.062 (p = 0.153) for GG homozygotes and beta = -0.013 (p  = 0.772) for AG heterozygotes. Effect size of risk factors (age > 50 years,  diabetes and body mass index > 23) was found significantly associated with  essential hypertension, beta = 0.747 (p = 0.000).The risk factors increased the  effect by 12.04 fold in GG genotype and further 3 fold influence of risk factors   is required with single allele-G in case of AG heterozygotes. CONCLUSION:  Essential hypertension risk conferred by this polymorphism in the study  population is different from the previously reported European population,  suggesting that the variant G allele remains less associated in the absence of  environmental risk factors."|"risk,allele,hypertension,factors,study"|"allele,risk,factors,hypertension,95" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution features of Chinese medical  constitutions in hypertension complicated diabetes patients. METHODS: Recruited  were 251 primary hypertension inpatients at the Department of Neurology and the  Department of Cardiology, Mindong Hospital of Ningde City from October 2010 to  March 2011. They were assigned to two groups according to whether they were  complicated with diabetes, i.e., the primary hypertension complicated diabetes  (as the case group, 78 cases) and the primary hypertension without complicated  diabetes (as the control group, 173 cases). The constitution types were  investigated by questionnaire. The constitution type distribution was compared  between the two groups. The data including gender, age, and the distribution of  the constitution type were compared between the two groups. The levels of TG, TC,  LDL-C, Hb, FPG, and ALB were detected on the 2nd day after admission. The levels   of TG, TC, LDL-C, Hb, and ALB were compared be- tween the two groups in patients   of yin deficiency constitution, phlegm dampness constitution, and qi deficiency  constitution. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the hypertension  grading, the disease course, and chronic disease complications between the two  groups (P > 0.05). The main constitution types were yin deficiency (accounting  for 26.0%), phlegm dampness (accounting for 19.1%), and qi deficiency (accounting  for 19.1%) in the control group. The main constitution types were yin deficiency   (accounting for 32.1%), phlegm dampness (accounting for 30.8%), and qi deficiency  (accounting for 17.9%) in the case group. The ratio of phlegm dampness type in  the case group was higher than that in the control group with statistical  difference (P = 0.041). There was no statistical difference in the constitution  distribution in the same gender between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no  statistical difference in the constitution distribution in those younger than 80   years between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with those older than 80 years   in the control group, the ratio of phlegm dampness was higher, and the ratios of   yang deficiency, yin deficiency, qi deficiency, and dampness heat were lower in  the case group with statistical difference (P = 0.020). There was no statistical   difference in the constitution distribution among different age stages in the  case group (P > 0. 05). But there was statistical difference in the constitution   distribution among different age stages in the control group (P < 0.05). The yin   deficiency and qi deficiency constitutions were dominated in thinner patients of   the control group, while yin deficiency constitution was dominated in thinner  patients of the case group, showing no statistical difference between the two  groups (P > 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the distribution of  constitution type in overweight patients between the two groups (P = 0.458).  Compared with those of gentle type constitution in the same group, the levels of   TC and LDL-C increased in those of phlegm dampness constitution in the two groups  (P < 0.05). The level of TC increased in those of qi deficiency constitution in  the case group. The level of Hb decreased in those of qi deficiency constitution   in the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with those of qi deficiency  constitution in the same group, the levels of TC and Hb obviously increased in  those of phlegm dampness constitution in the control group (P < 0.05). The level   of ALB increased in those of yin deficiency constitution in the case group (P <  0. 05). Compared with the control group, the level of FPG of those of each  constitution increased in the case group (P < 0.05) ,.and the level of TC  increased in those of qi deficiency constitution (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The  main constitution types of hypertension complicated diabetes patients were yin  deficiency, phlegm dampness, and qi deficiency. The ratio of phlegm dampness was   higher in hypertension complicated diabetes patients than hypertension without  complicated diabetes patients. The levels of TC and LDL-C were higher in those of  phlegm dampness constitution type. The level of TC was higher in hypertension  complicated diabetes patients of qi deficiency constitution."|"constitution,group,hypertension,two,groups"|"constitution,deficiency,group,05,dampness" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: White coat effect (WCE) (i.e., the difference between  office blood pressure [OBP] and awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring  [ABPM]) may be present in hypertensive individuals. The relationship between  occurrence of WCE and target organ damage (TOD) has not yet been assessed in true  resistant hypertension (RHTN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: RHTN patients were divided  into two groups: RHTN with WCE (WCE, n=66) and RHTN without WCE (non-WCE, n=61).   All patients were submitted to OBP measurement, ABPM, echocardiography and renal   function evaluation in three visits. RESULTS: No differences were observed  between the WCE and non-WCE groups regarding age, body mass index or gender. OBP   were 169.8+/-15.8/95.1+/-14.0 (WCE) and 161.9+/-9.0/90.1+/-10.4mmHg (non-WCE),  ABPM=143.0+/-12.8/86.1+/-9.9 (WCE) and 146.1+/-13.6/85.1+/-14.9mmHg (non-WCE). No  statistical differences were observed between WCE and non-WCE subgroups with  respect to left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (WCE=131+/-4.7;  non-WCE=125+/-2.9g/m(2)), creatinine clearance (WCE=78+/-4.7;  non-WCE=80+/-3.6ml/min/m(2)) and microalbuminuria (MA) (WCE=44+/-8.4;  non-WCE=49+/-6.8mg/g Cr). CONCLUSIONS: This finding may suggest that WCE is not  associated with additional increase of TOD in true RHTN subjects."|"wce,non,abpm,rhtn,obp"|"wce,non,rhtn,abpm,obp" 
"AB  - Hypertensive crises can be divided into two categories as hypertensive emergency   and hypertensive urgency. Most authorities have defined hypertensive emergency as  a situation that requires immediate reduction in blood pressure (BP) with  parenteral agents because of acute or progressive target organ damage, whereas  hypertensive urgency is a situation with markedly elevated BP but without severe   symptoms or progressive target organ damage, wherein the BP should be reduced  within hours, often with oral agents. Adolescent with hypertension should be  suspected of having renovascular hypertension in spite of other causes. This case  is presenting a 16-year-old boy with hypertensive crises due to suspected  renovascular hypertension. His blood pressure was 240/120 at admission with  hypertensive retinopathy grade III and there was increase in creatinine after  administering ACE-inhibitor but his renal arteriography revealed normal, other  physical examination and laboratory findings was normal. Regarding these  findings, the conclusion was this patient got essential hypertension. As many  hypertensive crises occur in any ages, clinicians should aware the possibility of  renovascular hypertension in young patients with hypertensive crises. An early  detection and urgent treatment are needed to prevent the implication of  progressive target organ damage."|"hypertensive,hypertension,crises,bp,renovascular"|"hypertensive,hypertension,crises,bp,damage" 
"AB  - PURPOSE: The G-protein beta3-subunit gene C825T polymorphism (GNB3-C825T) has  been reported to be associated with essential hypertension (EH), but results from  previous studies are conflicting. The present study aimed at investigating the  association between this polymorphism and risk of EH using a meta-analysis on the  published studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CBM (China Biological  Medicine Database), Wanfang and VIP databases were searched to identify eligible   studies published in English and Chinese before March 2013. Data were extracted  using standardized methods. The association was assessed by the odds ratio (OR)  with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Begg's test was used to measure publication  bias. RESULTS: A total of 40 case-control studies containing 16,518 EH patients  and 20,284 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, a significant  association was found between GNB3 C825T polymorphism and risk of EH when all  studies were pooled with a random-effects model for T versus C (OR=1.09, 95% CI:   1.04-1.19). In the subgroup analysis, the same association was found in overall  Caucasian (T versus C, OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.24) and Chinese populations (TT  versus CC, OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.57). No associations were detected between  GNB3-C825T and the risk of EH overall in Asian and Japanese people. CONCLUSIONS:   Meta-analysis results suggest that the GNB3-C825T polymorphism is associated with  risk of EH in the overall population, the Caucasians and the Chinese. The effect   of the variants on the expression levels and the possible functional role of the   variants in EH should be addressed in further studies."|"eh,studies,c825t,association,analysis"|"eh,studies,c825t,95,analysis" 
"AB  - In spite of the extensive research efforts that have been conducted over the last  decades, it is still very difficult to point out genetic determinants or  environmental conditions responsible for the development of essential  hypertension. We searched for differences in the RBC membrane skeleton structure   and O2 membrane permeability between RBCs from patients with both essential  arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, from patients having only  hypercholesterolemia and from healthy donors. The topography of RBCs and the  content of various hemoglobin forms were detected using atomic force microscopy  and Mossbauer spectroscopy, respectively. We found that the membrane skeleton of   RBCs from healthy donors displayed a well-known honeycomb pattern, whereas in  patients with essential hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia, who had never  received anti-hypertensive therapy, it displayed a corncob pattern. Hypertensive   RBCs had an oval shape and the average lateral to longitudinal diameter ratio for  the changed cells (about 70%) did not exceed 0.80. We observed that after the  incubation of RBCs under high nitrogen (low O2) pressure at room temperature and   then their transfer into 85 K, a content of oxyHb (deoxyHbOH) already after 1 h  reached a stable level of about 85 +/- 3% (15 +/- 3%) in hypertensives, whereas  in healthy individuals it showed a decrease for deoxyHbOH and an increase for  oxyHb, which stabilized at a level of about 81 +/- 5% and 19 +/- 5%,  respectively, only after 9 h. Quantitative analysis of the Delta(oxyHb) change  estimated as the difference between the oxyHb level measured after 9 and 2 h at  85 K under low N2 pressure (to slow down oxyHb formation) was significantly  higher in normotensives than in hypertensive patients with or without  hypercholesterolemia, 19.9 versus -4.2, p < 0.02. Our findings indicate an  impaired oxygen release by Hb in RBCs of patients with hypertension under low  oxygen pressure which if present in vivo may cause hypoxemia and, in turn,  further increase of blood pressure."|"rbcs,oxyhb,patients,pressure,hypertension"|"rbcs,oxyhb,patients,hypercholesterolemia,hypertension" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Central blood pressure (BP) is pathophysiologically more important  than peripheral BP for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Arterial  stiffness is also a good predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The  effects of benidipine, a unique dual L-/T-type calcium channel blocker, on  central BP have not been reported. This study aimed to compare the effect of  benidipine and losartan on the central BP and arterial stiffness in mild to  moderate essential hypertensives. METHODS: This 24 weeks, multi-center, open  label, randomized, active drug comparative, parallel group study was designed as   a non-inferiority study. The eligible patients (n = 200) were randomly assigned  to receive benidipine (n = 101) or losartan (n = 99). Radial artery applanation  tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to measure the central BP, pulse wave  velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx). We also measured the metabolic and  inflammatory markers. RESULTS: After 24 weeks, the central BP decreased  significantly from baseline by (16.8 +/- 14.0/10.5 +/- 9.2) mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133   kPa) (systolic/diastolic BP; P < 0.001) in benidipine group and (18.9 +/-  14.7/12.1 +/- 10.2) mmHg (P < 0.001) in losartan group respectively. Both  benidipine and losartan groups significantly lowered peripheral BP (P < 0.001)  and AIx (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between the two  groups. The mean aortic, brachial and femoral PWV did not change in both groups  after 24-week treatment. There were no significant changes of the blood metabolic  and inflammatory biomarkers in each group. CONCLUSION: Benidipine is as effective  as losartan in lowering the central and peripheral BP, and improving arterial  stiffness."|"bp,central,benidipine,losartan,group"|"bp,benidipine,central,losartan,group" 
"AB  - This study has attempted to evaluate the relationship between aortic stiffness,  blood pressure (BP) and serum endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in patients with  essential HT. Totally 152 subjects, consisting of 103 patients diagnosed with HT   at least 1 year previously and 49 healthy individuals, were enrolled in this  study. They were subdivided, on the basis of BP measurements made at home, into  three groups as the hypertensives with dysregulated BP (n = 56), the  hypertensives with regulated BP (n = 47) and the normotensive controls (n = 49).   Statistically significant differences were observed between the three groups with  respect to aortic elasticity parameters (p < 0.01 for aortic strain, aortic  distensibility and aortic stiffness). Serum ET-1 levels in the three groups were   similar (p = 0.101), but a significant correlation was observed between the ET-1   values and the aortic elasticity parameters (p = 0.004). Alteration of the aortic  elasticity parameters in patients with HT not only correlates with the serum ET-1  levels indicating endothelial dysfunction but also gives direct clues about  status of BP regulation."|"bp,aortic,et,three,groups"|"aortic,bp,et,elasticity,groups" 
"AB  - High levels of circulating Von Willebrand factor (vWf) and increased neutrophil  to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio may reflect vascular inflammation in hypertensive  patients. In present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of valsartan as  an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and amlodipine as a calcium channel blocker  on the vWf levels and N/L ratio in patients with essential hypertension. Patients  were randomized to one of the following intervention protocols: calcium channel  blocker (amlodipine, 5-10 mg/day) as group A (n = 20 mean age = 51.85 +/- 11.32  y) and angiotensine II receptor blocker (valsartan, 80-320 mg/day) as group B (n   = 26 mean age = 49.12 +/- 14.12 y). Endothelial dysfunction and vascular  inflammation were evaluated with vWf levels and N/L ratio in hypertensive  patients before treatment and after treatment in the 12th week. No statistically   significant differences were found among the groups in terms of age, sex, and  body mass index (BMI). There was a significant decrease in vWf levels (P < .001)   and N/L ratio after treatment (P = .04, P < .001, respectively) in both the  groups. Von Willebrand factor levels and N/L ratio are very important markers  having a role in vascular inflammation and antihypertensive treatment with  amlodipine and valsartan may improve cardiovascular outcomes by decreasing these   biomarkers."|"vwf,ratio,levels,valsartan,amlodipine"|"levels,ratio,patients,treatment,vwf" 
"AB  - Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is  associated with several metabolic disorders like dyslipidemia. Higher levels of  triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are quite strong factors for the  development of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the  effects of valsartan and amlodipine on the lipid profile in patients with newly  diagnosed essential hypertension. We observed a beneficial effect of amlodipine  on the lipid profile with a significant reduction of LDL compared to valsartan.  In the treatment of hypertension, prior knowledge of the plasma cholesterol  levels can be important in antihypertensive drug choice."|"hypertension,levels,ldl,diseases,cardiovascular"|"hypertension,amlodipine,cardiovascular,diseases,ldl" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension is one of the major contributors to premature morbidity  and mortality due to the incresased risk for coronary heart disease, stroke,  renal disease, peripheral vascular disease and vascular dementia for both men and  women. However, its basic causes remain unknown. In the present work we studied  the activity of several proteolytic regulatory enzymes related to  renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) (aminopeptidase A, APA; aminopeptidase N, APN;  aminopeptidase B, APB; and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, IRAP); with oxytocin  regulation (oxytocinase); with the metabolism of GnRH and TRH (pyrrolidone  carboxypeptidase, Pcp); and with enkephalins metabolism (enkephalindegrading  activity, EDA), to elucidate their role in the mechanisms responsible of  essential hypertension and to discuss the possible gender differences. Serum  samples of 53 individuals with essential hypertension and 60 healthy volunteers  were collected and used to assay enzyme activities, gonad hormones testosterone  and estradiol, TSH and free thyroxin (fT4). Differences were observed in APA,  APN, Pcp and EDA specific activities, and in serum gonad hormone levels between  hypertensive and control groups. Only Pcp activity showed gender differences.  Regarding the RAS, APA is reduced while APN is increased, suggesting increased  levels of angiotensin II and a facilitation of the conversion of angiotensin III   in angiotensin IV. Thus, the changes in several RAS-regulating specific  activities and other enzyme activities involved in the neuroendocrine modulation   of gonad and stress-related functions are related to essential hypertension with   minor gender differences. Therefore, aminopeptidases constitute new elements for   the knowledge of the causes of essential hypertension and an alternative as  therapeutic targets against the illness."|"essential,hypertension,differences,activities,activity"|"essential,hypertension,activities,aminopeptidase,angiotensin" 
"AB  - AIMS: Our aim was to evaluate the effects of endothelial nitric oxide synthase  (eNOS) E298D polymorphism in obesity variables and essential hypertension (eHT)  development risk. The genotype frequencies of E298D polymorphism in eHT patients   and non-hypertensive (non-HT) controls (proven to have normal coronaries  angiographically) were analyzed for their association with demographic and  obesity related data of the eHT patients and controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  eNOS gene E298D genotypes were determined with qPCR. RESULTS: The eNOS E298D  polymorphism frequencies for 298E/E, 298E/D and 298D/D genotypes were  respectively as 41.1%, 44.6%, 14.3% in subjects eHT and 52.8%, 38.9%, 8.3% in the  non-HT groups. The combined E298D homozygous polymorphic and heterozygous  genotypes were found to have a decreasing effect on serum total-cholesterol  levels in comparison to wild-type genotypes in eHT patients but not controls.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the idea that, the eNOS E298D polymorphism,  which is not associated with hypertension, may increase the risk of hypertension   when associated with high serum total-cholesterol levels."|"e298d,eht,genotypes,enos,polymorphism"|"e298d,eht,enos,genotypes,polymorphism" 
"AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide,  with hypertension being a major risk factor. Numerous studies support the  contribution of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the pathogenesis of  hypertension, as well as other pathologies associated with ischemia/reperfusion.   However, the validation of oxidative stress-related biomarkers in these settings   is still lacking and novel association of these biomarkers and other biomarkers  such as endothelial progenitor cells, endothelial microparticles, and ischemia  modified albumin, is just emerging. Oxidative stress has been suggested as a  pathogenic factor and therapeutic target in early stages of essential  hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated positively with  plasma F2-isoprostane levels and negatively with total antioxidant capacity of  plasma in hypertensive and normotensive patients. Cardiac surgery with  extracorporeal circulation causes an ischemia/reperfusion event associated with  increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, two biomarkers associated  with oxidative damage of cardiac tissue. An enhancement of the antioxidant  defense system should contribute to ameliorating functional and structural  abnormalities derived from this metabolic impairment. However, data have to be  validated with the analysis of the appropriate oxidative stress and/or  nitrosative stress biomarkers."|"oxidative,hypertension,biomarkers,ischemia,associated"|"biomarkers,oxidative,stress,associated,hypertension" 
"AB  - Study of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms has been performed to determine the  factors of genetic predisposition to essential hypertension. Polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) with subsequent analysis of restriction fragment length, allele  specific PCR or real-time PCR was used for genotyping of 17 single nucleotide  polymorphisms in 14 genes in 145 children with essential hypertension and 144  healthy persons with following complex multivariate statistical analysis. Two  single nucleotide polymorphisms--MMP9 (C(-1562) --> T) and NOS3 (Glu298 -->  Asp)--rs3918242 and rs1799983--were shown to represent the main independent  effects with the highest predictive potential (77.1% as indicated by binary  logistic regression and 74.6% testing accuracy shown by Multifactorial  Dimensionality Reduction). MMP9 (C(-1562 --> T) and NOS3 (Glu298 --> Asp)  potentially may be used to create predictive algorithm for determination of  predisposition to arterial hypertension in children."|"pcr,shown,predictive,analysis,hypertension"|"hypertension,nucleotide,pcr,polymorphisms,single" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether the angiotensin II type-1 receptor  blocker (ARB) candesartan affects markers of oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes   mellitus (DM) patients with essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: Urinary  excretion of pyrraline (PR), pentosidine (PT), acrolein (AC), and  8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and microalbuminuria were assessed in  patients with DM complicated by EH who were treated with candesartan 4 mg/day for  3 months. RESULTS: In a total of 25 patients urinary excretion of PR (nmol/g .  cr), PT (pmol/g . cr), and 8-OH-dG (ng/mg . cr) was significantly (all P < 0.05)   decreased from (mean +/- SEM) 11.9 +/- 1.9, 30.6 +/- 2.4, and 7.9 +/- 0.6,  respectively, at baseline to 8.4 +/- 1.4, 27.1 +/- 2.0, and 6.9 +/- 0.6,  respectively, at 3 months. Meanwhile, excretion of AC was unaltered from 209.6  +/- 40.0 to 189 +/- 24.8 nmol/mgcr (P = NS). Urinary albumin excretion was  significantly (P < 0.05) reduced from 27.7 +/- 4.6 to 14.1 +/- 1.1 mg/g . cr.  There were weak but statistically significant positive correlations between the  change of urinary 8-OH-dG excretion and that of albumin (r = 0.414; P < 0.05) and  change of hemoglobin (Hb) A1c (r = 0.45; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Candesartan  exerts protective effect(s) on the cardiovascular system by suppression of  oxidative stress--mainly through inhibiting production of advanced glycation end   products (AGEs) rather than of advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs)--in type  2 DM patients with EH."|"excretion,urinary,type,patients,candesartan"|"excretion,05,cr,patients,urinary"

"AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This multicenter, prospective, observational study assessed the   renoprotective effects of losartan/thiazide combination therapy in terms of  lowering the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). METHODS: Adult patients  with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)-resistant essential hypertension (n =  104) were enrolled and switched to combination therapy with losartan (50 mg/day)   and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/day). RESULTS: eGFR values declined  significantly during the first 3 months, and changes in eGFR were assessed  according to tertiles of the eGFR decrease ratio at 3 months. Only the high eGFR   decrease (1st tertile) group showed significantly greater decreases in baseline  eGFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) during the first 3 months.  Additionally, the assessment according to tertiles of the baseline eGFR showed a   signifcant decrease in eGFR and ACR during the first 3 months in the high  baseline eGFR (1st tertile) group, but not in the moderate (2nd tertile) and low   baseline eGFR (3rd tertile) groups. CONCLUSION: The present results revealed that  losartan/thiazide combination therapy attenuated glomerular overload, indicating   that this therapy may provide glomerular protection in patients with an elevated   GFR without causing prolonged damage to renal function."|"egfr,baseline,therapy,glomerular,losartan"|"egfr,baseline,months,tertile,therapy" 
"AB  - A total of 58 patients with essential hypertension were examined. 27 of them had   a combination of essential hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD), 31 persons had isolated essential hypertension. The control group  included 13 healthy individuals. The daily monitoring of blood pressure with a  BPLab apparatus and the analysis of peripheral and central aortic pressure were  performed. Comparison of groups was carried out using the Mann-Whitney test. The   combination of hypertension and COPD was associated with increased daily and  average daily peripheral and central aortic pressure compared with isolated  essential hypertension and the control group. During daily monitoring of  peripheral blood pressure the "dipper" type predominated in patients with  isolated essential hypertension (41, 95%) and "non-dipper" type in those with  comorbid disorders (44, 44%). The analysis of nocturnal blood pressure reduction   in the aorta in patients with essential hypertension and COPD revealed the  increased frequency of "non-dipper" type (55, 55%). The analysis of the central  aortic pressure in patients with isolated essential hypertension showed the  decreased incidence of "dipper" type (21, 87%). It is concluded that daily  monitoring of the central aortic pressure permits to identify abnormal profiles  with a higher frequency than the study of peripheral blood pressure."|"hypertension,pressure,essential,dipper,type"|"hypertension,pressure,essential,daily,aortic" 
"AB  - The familiar history of hypertension in healthy young offsprings is associated  with hyperinsulinemia, which could lead to increased serum cortisol, resulting in  renal endothelial damage and the presence of microalbuminuria. The aim of this  study was to evaluate, in healthy young offsprings of hypertensive parents,  association between insulin levels, serum cortisol and microalbuminuria attending  to its relationship with increased cardiovascular risk. We performed a  cross-sectional correlational study in Santa Fe, Argentina, including 145 healthy  individuals aged over 18 years, allocated to two groups: those with a history of   essential hypertensive parents (study group) and those without such history  (control group). We evaluated fasting serum insulin, cortisol, and  microalbuminuria levels in the first morning urine. The mean age was 20 +/- 2.9  years, and 58% were women. The study group included 48% (n = 69) of the sample.  4.8% had insulin resistance, microalbuminuria 13.8% and 52% hipercortisolinemia,   with no significant differences in serum insulin, cortisol, or microalbuminuria  between groups. No correlation was found between these variables.

"AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether the implementation of  the quality system (QS) in primary healthcare made the care of chronically ill  patients in family practice more consistent and reduced the load in specialized  medical care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A quantitative retrospective cohort study  using the database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund was provided. Patients  with diagnosed essential hypertension (HYP) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2)  formed the study group. If the family physician met the criteria for the  monitoring of patients with DM2 and HYP set in the QS, the result was defined as   positive. The number of disease-specific hospitalizations, the length of hospital  stay, and the number of visits to family physicians and medical specialists due  to HYP or DM2 in 2005-2008 were evaluated. RESULTS: Chronically ill patients (DM2  and HYP) in the lists of family physicians with a positive QS result were 1.26  times more likely (95% CI, 1.25-1.28) to be continuously monitored than those in   the lists of family physicians with a negative QS result. The 2 coexisting  chronic diseases (DM2 and HYP) increased the chance of being continuously  monitored and increased the number of visits. The chance of being monitored by a   medical specialist alone was reduced if the family physician participated in the   QS (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.64-0.69) and had a rural practice (OR, 0.53; 95% CI,  0.51-0.55) and if the patient was a woman and older and had a diagnosis of HYP  alone. The participation of family physicians in the QS reduced the  hospitalization risk (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) as well as the number of  hospitalizations for the patients with HYP (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99).  CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the QS in primary healthcare reduces the load   in specialized medical care. A more detailed analysis of the effect of the QS on   the workload and the organization of family practice as well as on the patients'   morbidity and satisfaction could be done in the near future."|"family,hyp,qs,patients,dm2"|"family,qs,hyp,patients,95"

"AB  - Essential hypertension (EH) is an etiological risk factor that poses a serious  threat to human health. The aim of this study therefore was to investigate the  correlation between the two SNPs (rs1805067 and rs2397771) of the norepinephrine   (NE) transporter gene in the sympathetic nervous system and essential  hypertension (EH). A total of 96 hypertensive patients (EH group) and 96 normal  subjects (control group) were selected by epidemiological investigation and the  sequences at rs1805067 and rs2397771 in the two groups were investigated using  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. In the EH group, systolic   and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), levels of creatinine,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and the  percentage of drinkers were found to be higher compared with those of the control  group (P<0.05). The results of the analysis of the allele frequencies of  rs1805067 (A/G) revealed that there was no difference between the two groups  (P>0.05). The analysis results of the allele frequencies of rs2397771 (C/G) in  the EH group revealed that G accounted for 48.96% and C for 51.04% of the  patients, while in the control group, these values were 64.58 and 35.42%,  respectively. These results indicated a significant difference between the two  groups (P<0.05). In the population studied, the onset of EH may be correlated  with BMI, TG, LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). EH may be  related to the rs2397771 (C/G) C allele polymorphism of the NE transporter gene  but not to rs1805067 (A/G)."|"eh,group,rs2397771,two,rs1805067"|"eh,group,rs1805067,rs2397771,05" 
"AB  - Abnormal left ventricle (LV) geometric patterns are associated with a greater  risk of hypertensive vascular complications. The mean platelet volume (MPV)  reflects the platelet activity, and is associated with overall vascular  mortality. Although association between MPV and LV hypertrophy in hypertensive  patients has been investigated, relation between abnormal LV geometric patterns  and MPV was not studied so far. The aim of this study is to investigate the  relationship between MPV and abnormal LV geometric patterns in hypertensive  patients. Measurements were obtained from 223 patients with untreated essential  hypertension (Mean age = 52.1 +/- 5.2 years). Four different geometric patterns  (NG; normal geometry, CR; concentric remodelling, EH; eccentric hypertrophy, CH;   concentric hypertrophy) were determined according to the LV mass index (LVMI) and  relative wall thickness (RWth). MPV, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP)  and other biochemical markers were measured in all patients. The highest MPV  values were determined in CH group compared with NG, CR and EH groups (p < 0.05,   for all). MPV values were similar among the NG, CR and EH groups (p > 0.05, for  all). MPV was associated with age, glucose, hsCRP, RWth, LVMI and LV geometry in   bivariate analysis (p < 0.05, for all). Age (beta = 0.110, p = 0.033), LVMI (beta  = 0.471, p < 0.001) and hsCRP (beta = 0.525, p < 0.001) were independent  predictors of high MPV in multiple linear regression analysis. The highest MPV  values were observed in the CH group. This result may be associated with  increased inflammation and LV hypertrophy in this geometric pattern."|"mpv,lv,associated,geometric,patients"|"mpv,lv,geometric,associated,hypertrophy" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent genome-wide association study identified STK39as a candidate  gene for blood pressure (BP) in Europeans. Subsequently, several studies have  attempted to replicate the association across different ethnic populations.  However, the results have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We performed   a meta-analysis to elucidate the association between the STK39 rs3754777  polymorphism (or proxy) and hypertension. Published literature from PubMed and  Embase databases were retrieved and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence  interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. RESULTS: Using  appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified 10 studies that included   21, 863 hypertensive cases and 24, 480 controls from different ethnicities. The  meta-analysis showed a significant association of STK39 rs3754777 variant with  hypertension (OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 1.06-1.15, p = 7.95 x 10(-6)). Further subgroup   analysis by ethnicity suggested that the association was significant in Europeans  (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03-1.14, p = 0.002) and in East Asians (OR = 1.16, 95%CI =  1.07-1.25, p = 4.34 x 10(-4)), but not in Africans (OR = 1.01, 95%CI 0.80-1.27, p  = 0.932). We further confirmed the positive association by sensitivity analysis.   No publication bias was detected (Begg's test, p = 0.721; Egger's test, p =  0.744). CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis confirms the significant  association of STK39 polymorphism with susceptibility to hypertension in  Europeans and East Asians. Future studies should include gene-gene and  gene-environment interactions to investigate the identified association."|"association,analysis,europeans,identified,studies"|"association,95,analysis,ci,10" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasound measured Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) is a simple  and inexpensive tool for assessing the cumulative effects of hypertension on the   carotid arterial walls. It is also an independent predictor of future myocardial   infarction and stroke risk. OBJECTIVES: This study compared ultrasound measured  CIMT in hypertensive adults with non-smoking normotensive controls. It also  documented variations in CIMT with subjects' age and sex. METHODOLOGY:  Hypertensives (120) of both sexes aged 18 years and above were recruited from the  Hypertension Clinic at University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan. Normotensive  controls (120) were also recruited from the general public. The CIMT was measured  on B- mode ultrasound using the technique of 'Multiple Carotid Sites Measurement'  RESULTS: Mean CIMT values were 0.756 mm +/- 0.130 and 0.751 mm +/- 0.129 for the   hypertensive group and 0.638 mm +/- 0.088 and 0.67 0mm +/- 0.107 for the control   group on the left and right sides respectively (P=0.000). Higher CIMT values were  noted among male hypertensive subjects (P=0.030). CIMT values also showed  positive correlation with subjects' age. CONCLUSION: There was a significant  difference in CIMT for hypertensives when compared with normotensives in the  study area. CIMT also varies with subjects' age and sex."|"cimt,also,carotid,measured,subjects"|"cimt,subjects,age,carotid,hypertensive" 
"AB  - In young healthy subjects, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids synthesized by endothelial  cytochrome P450 epoxygenases maintain basal conduit artery diameter during  altered NO availability. Whether this compensatory mechanism is effective during   essential hypertension is unknown. Radial artery diameter, blood flow, and mean  wall shear stress were determined in 14 nontreated essential hypertensive  patients and 14 normotensive control subjects during 8 minutes of brachial  infusion for inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases (fluconazole, 0.4  micromol/min) and NO synthase (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, 8 micromol/min) alone   and in combination. In controls, the radial artery diameter was reduced by  fluconazole (-0.034 +/- 0.012 mm) and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (-0.037 +/-  0.010 mm) and to a larger extent by their combination (-0.137 +/- 0.011 mm),  demonstrating a synergic effect. In contrast, the radial diameter in hypertensive  patients was not affected by fluconazole (0.010 +/- 0.014 mm) but was reduced by   N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (-0.091 +/- 0.008 mm) to a larger extent than in  controls. In parallel, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine decreased local plasma nitrite   to a lesser extent in hypertensive patients (-14 +/- 5 nmol/L) than in controls  (-50 +/- 10 nmol/L). Moreover, the addition of fluconazole to  N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine did not further decrease radial diameter in patients  (-0.086 +/- 0.011 mm). Accordingly, fluconazole significantly decreased local  epoxyeicosatrienoic acid plasma level in controls (-2.0 +/- 0.6 ng/mL) but not in  patients (-0.9 +/- 0.4 ng/mL). Inhibitors effects on blood flow and  endothelium-independent dilatation to sodium nitroprusside were similar between  groups. These results show that, in contrast to normotensive subjects,  epoxyeicosatrienoic acids did not contribute to the regulation of basal conduit  artery diameter and did not compensate for altered NO availability to maintain  this diameter in essential hypertensive patients."|"diameter,fluconazole,patients,controls,arginine"|"diameter,mm,patients,arginine,fluconazole" 
"AB  - In essential hypertension, increased renal resistive index (RRI) is associated to  a reduction of renal function and microalbuminuria, and to renal  tubulo-interstitial damage. A tubulo-interstitial inflammatory infiltration was  found in experimental models of hypertension, and serum high-sensitive C-reactive  protein (hsCRP) levels correlated with urinary markers of tubulo-interstitial  damage in humans. We studied the relationship between RRI and serum hsCRP in  hypertensives with preserved renal function, without microalbuminuria. We  investigated hypertensive patients without diabetes, renal failure,  microalbuminuria or major inflammatory disease. Serum levels of hsCRP were  assayed. RRI was calculated by intrarenal Doppler ultrasound and considered  pathologic when >/=0.70 or >95% of upper confidence limit expected for age  decade. The renal volume-to-resistive index ratio (RV/RRI) was also calculated.  We evaluated 85 patients (57+/-14 years, 61 males). Patients with pathologic RRI   (n=21) were older and had significantly higher hsCRP levels (4.70+/-2.30 vs  2.93+/-2.09 mg l(-1), P<0.01) compared with patients with normal RRI, as well as   patients with decreased RV/RRI (n=43). HsCRP was directly related with RRI  (r=0.41, P<0.001) and inversely with RV/RRI (r=-0.35, P<0.001). HsCRP proved to  be a significant predictor of both pathologic RRI and decreased RV/RRI, even  after adjustment. In essential hypertension low-grade inflammation is associated   with tubulo-interstitial damage evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography."|"rri,hscrp,renal,patients,interstitial"|"rri,hscrp,renal,patients,interstitial" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the relationship between the renin/aldosterone  profiles of patients with essential hypertension and their prognosis using a  long-term follow-up study design. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 125 Japanese  patients with essential hypertension whose plasma-renin activity (PRA) (ng/ml per  h), plasma-aldosterone concentration (PAC) (ng/dl), and ratio of PAC to PRA  [aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR)] were determined under hospitalization from 1984  to 1993. The patients were divided into two groups according to their ARRs  relative to the 50th percentile of the ARR value (ARR = 5.5); the low-ARR group  (ARR <5.5, n = 66) and high-ARR group (ARR > 5.5, n = 59). Their clinical  outcomes were monitored during follow-up by the attending physicians. RESULTS:  Ninety-six patients with essential hypertension (77% of the original cohort) were  eligible for the analyses. The mean follow-up time was 18.6 +/- 5.2 years. The  cardiovascular morbidity was significantly higher in the high-ARR group than in  the low-ARR group 3.2 vs. 2.4 per 100 patient-years, respectively (P = 0.014 by  Kaplan-Meier analysis). Among the cardiovascular events, the incidence of stroke   was 2.7-fold higher in the high-ARR group than in the low-ARR group. High ARR was  an independent risk marker for cardiovascular events by Cox proportional hazards   model analysis. CONCLUSION: : High ARR was an independent risk marker for  cardiovascular events in patients with essential hypertension."|"arr,patients,cardiovascular,follow,hypertension"|"arr,group,high,patients,cardiovascular" 
"AB  - Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction have been associated with essential   hypertension (EH) mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the  effect of carvedilol and nebivolol on the oxidative stress-related parameters and  endothelial function in patients with EH. The studied population included 57  patients, either sex, between 30 and 75 years of age, with mild-to-moderate EH  complications. Participants were randomized to receive either carvedilol (12.5  mg) (n = 23) or nebivolol (5 mg) (n = 21) for 12 weeks. Measurements included;  24-hr ambulatory blood pressure (BP), flow-mediated dilatation, levels of nitric   oxide estimated as nitrite - a nitric oxide metabolite ( NO(2)) - in plasma, and   oxidative stress-related parameters in plasma and erythrocyte. EH patients who  were treated with nebivolol or carvedilol showed systolic BP reductions of 17.4  and 19.9 mmHg, respectively, compared with baseline values (p < 0.01). Diastolic   BP was reduced by 13.7 and 12.8 mmHg after the treatment with ebivolol and  carvedilol, respectively (p < 0.01) (fig. 2B). Nebivolol and carvedilol showed  7.3% and 8.1% higher endothelium-dependent dilatation in relation to baseline  values (p < 0.05). Ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and reduced  glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSSH) ratio showed 31.5% and 29.6% higher  levels in the carvedilol group compared with basal values; however,  nebivolol-treated patients did not show significant differences after treatment.   On the other hand, the NO(2) plasma concentration was not modified by the  administration of carvedilol. However, nebivolol enhanced these levels in 62.1%  after the treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the antihypertensive   effect of both beta-blockers. However, carvedilol could mediate these effects by   an increase in antioxidant capacity and nebivolol through the raise in NO(2)  concentration. Further studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanism of  these effects."|"carvedilol,nebivolol,eh,plasma,patients"|"carvedilol,nebivolol,eh,patients,plasma" 
"AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of serum uric acid  (UA) levels in hypertensive patients with the prognosis for cardiovascular  disease (CVD) and mortality. This hospital-based cohort study included 669  patients with essential hypertension. A questionnaire was used to identify  patients in whom hypertensive complications had occurred, as well as causes of  death. The primary end point of this study was new onset of stroke or CVD (new  onset of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or heart failure). We evaluated  the baseline characteristics of patients, including UA levels, and assessed  whether UA levels could be used to predict stroke and CVD. We also classified  subjects into four groups according to the serum UA levels. During a mean  follow-up period of 7.1+/-0.1 years, 71 strokes, 58 cases of CVD and 64 deaths  were recorded. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that subjects in the high UA group   had a higher frequency of stroke and CVD (P=0.0120) and total mortality  (P=0.0021). A Cox proportional hazard model determined that, after adjusting for   traditional risk factors, serum UA levels were predictive of CVD (relative  risk=1.30; P=0.0073), stroke and CVD (relative risk=1.19; P=0.0141), mortality  (relative risk=1.23; P=0.0353) and stroke CVD and mortality (relative risk=1.19;   P=0.0083), but not stroke (P=0.4268). The significant correlations were  particularly marked in women. Serum UA levels may be an independent risk factor  for stroke and CVD in patients with essential hypertension, particularly women."|"ua,cvd,levels,patients,stroke"|"cvd,stroke,ua,levels,risk" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased evidence suggests that apart from patients  with increased albumin excretion and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR);   there are also patients with type 2 diabetes with decreased GFR but without  albuminuria. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms regarding these clinical  conditions are not known. We suggest that different blood pressure (BP) levels  may be one the factors for these different clinical conditions. However, before  labeling BP as a causative factor; one must show whether BP levels are different   in these patients. Thus the current study was performed to analyze the  relationship between creatinine clearance, microalbuminuria and circadian blood  pressure levels in newly diagnosed essential hypertensive and type 2 diabetic  patients. METHODS: Medical history, physical examination, laboratory analysis and  ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPMs) were analyzed. 24-h urine  specimens were collected to measure creatinine clearance and albumin excretion  RESULTS: In total 216 patients were included which were divided into 4 groups:  group 1 composed of 90 patients with normal GFR and without microalbuminuria  (MA), group 2 composed of 50 patients with normal GFR and with MA, group 3  composed of 36 patients with decreased GFR and without MA and group 4 composed of  40 patients with both decreased GFR and MA. The ratio of dippers vs. non dippers   was not different between group 1, group 2 and group 3 patients. However ratio of  dippers was higher in group 1 when compared to group 4 (P: 0.003) and group 4  patients have an odds of 7.678 (CI: 1.657-35.576, P: 0.009) for non-dapping  status when compared to patients in group 1. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ABPM  measurements were highest in patients with both decreased GFR and MA, whereas  they are lowest in patients with normal GFR and normal UAE."|"patients,group,gfr,decreased,different"|"patients,group,gfr,decreased,ma" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: There are controversial results regarding the endothelial function in  patients with white coat hypertension (WCH). The aim of this study was to assess   endothelial function measuring nitric oxide (NO) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  level in WCH and to compare those with essential hypertension (EH) and healthy  subjects. METHODS: The 40 newly diagnosed patients with EH, 40 patients with WCH   and 40 healthy volunteers were included to study. Plasma CRP levels were measured  by immunonephelometery method. Plasma NO level was also detected by using the  Griess method. RESULTS: Plasma CRP level was significantly higher in patients  with EH when compared with those with WCH and healthy subjects (6.3 +/- 2.1 mg/l,  2.1 +/- 0.9 mg/l and 1.6 +/- 1.3 mg/l, p < 0.05, respectively). However, there  was no significant difference with respect to CRP level between those with WCH  and healthy subjects. NO level was significantly lower in patients with EH when  compared with those with WCH and healthy subjects (4.6 +/- 1.1 micromol/l, 6.9  +/- 1.2 micromol/l and 8.1 +/- 1.5 micromol/l, p < 0.05, respectively). There was  no significant difference with respect to NO level between those with WCH and  healthy subjects. Plasma CRP level was positively correlated with office,  daytime, night-time and 24-h blood pressure values, whereas NO level was  inversely correlated with these parameters. Plasma CRP level was also inversely  correlated with NO level. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CRP concentration is  significantly higher and NO level is meaningfully lower in patients with  essential hypertension when compared with those with WCH and controls. This may  suggest that endothelial functions are preserved in patients with WCH in contrast  to essential hypertension."|"level,crp,wch,patients,plasma"|"level,wch,crp,patients,healthy" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Serum urate levels have been associated with metabolic syndrome (MS).   However, the relationship between these two variables in patients with essential   arterial hypertension has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A  Cross-sectional study in 592 patients with essential hypertension. The MS was  defined according to the ATP-III criteria. We excluded patients with hypouricemic  treatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of MS was 52% (95% CI, 48-56%) and there was a  graded increase with increasing serum urate (uricemia </= 4.7 mg/dl, 36%;  uricemia >/= 6.8 mg/dl, 70%, P < 0.001). Hypertensive patients with MS showed a  higher mean uricemia than those without this comorbidity (6.1 +/- 1.5 mg/dl  versus 5.4 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, P < 0.0001). The prevalence of hyperuricemia (men, >  7.0 mg/dL; women, > 6.0 mg/dL) in hypertensive patients without diuretic  treatment, was 24% (in those with MS 40% versus 11% without MS). In multivariate   analysis, triglycerides (OR = 1.008, CI 95%: 1.004-1.012, P < 0.001) and body  mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.118, CI 95%: 1.059-1.181, P < 0.001), were independent  predictors of serum uric acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with essential  hypertension, about half have MS and one out of four has hyperuricemia. The most   important determinant of hyperuricemia is BMI."|"ms,patients,without,serum,essential"|"ms,patients,dl,mg,001" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension mostly originates from children. Salt  Sensitivity (SS) is regarded as the intermediate phenotype of essential  hypertension. The present study investigated the effects of salt-sensitivity on  evolution of blood pressure (BP) and development to hypertension from adolescents  to youth. METHODS: A baseline survey was carried out in 4,623 adolescents aged  6-15 years old in Hanzhong rural areas in 1987, 310 of whom (mean 9.2 years) were  randomly recruited for determination of salt sensitivity using the tests of oral   saline load and furosemide sodium-volume depletion. SS was diagnosed in 101  subjects while 209 were determined as non-salt-sensitive (NSS). We made a 18-year  followed-up of the cohort in 2005. RESULTS: The response rate for surviving  baseline adolescents was 71.9%. At follow up, BP in youth with baseline SS was  higher than that in NSS (SBP:122.9 +/- 13.1 VS 117.3 +/- 12.4, P < 0.01; DBP:  78.2 +/- 10.4 VS 74.7 +/- 10.8, P < 0.05). Longitudinal analysis of 18-year BP  evolution, subjects in SS had greater Systolic BP change than subjects in  NSS(19.6 +/- 12.714.7 +/- 12.2, P < 0.01). The incidence of hypertension in salt   sensitive group was higher than that in NSS group (15.5% VS 6.3%, RR = 2.34, P <   0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that adolescents with higher BP  salt-sensitivity have a higher rate of incident hypertension in youth. Salt  sensitivity could be at high risk predisposing to development of hypertension  from adolescents to youth."|"salt,sensitivity,hypertension,adolescents,ss"|"salt,hypertension,adolescents,bp,sensitivity" 
"AB  - We studied the relationships between the blood serum levels of human leukemia  differentiation factor HLDF, idiotypic and anti-idiotypic antibodies to HLDF, and  clinical indicators of cardiovascular function in apparently healthy individuals   and patients with essential hypertension and cerebral hypertensive crisis.  Markedly reduced HLDF levels and anti-HLDF antibody titers were found in the  blood of the examined patients. Correlations between HLDF levels, duration of  hypertension, and systolic and diastolic BP were revealed. These findings suggest  that the studied molecular factors are involved in the mechanisms of BP  regulation under normal conditions and during hypertension development. The  protein HLDF and anti-HLDF antibodies can be considered as biomarkers for early  diagnosis of hypertension and its cerebral complications."|"hldf,hypertension,levels,anti,patients"|"hldf,hypertension,anti,levels,antibodies" 
"AB  - Adrenal pheochromocytomas are neoplasms characterized by catecholamine excess.  Determination of metanephrines by high-pressure liquid chromatography has been  well established for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas, demonstrating high  sensitivity and specificity. This study evaluates the diagnostic value of newly  available enzyme immunoassays for metanephrines in plasma and urine. Chromogranin  A was studied as a potential additional diagnostic tool. Spontaneous blood  samples and 24-h urine samples were collected in 149 subjects, including 24  histologically proven pheochromocytomas, 17 aldosterone-secreting and 21  cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas, 30 nonfunctioning adrenal masses, 15  patients with essential hypertension and 42 healthy normotensive volunteers.  Plasma and urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine as well as chromogranin A  were determined and putative thresholds were calculated by ROC analysis. Plasma  free normetanephrine was found to be the best single parameter with the highest  sensitivity (89.5%) and speci fi city (98.3%) using a threshold of 167 pg/ml.  Analysis of the combination of plasma free metanephrines revealed a similar  sensitivity with lower specificity of 90.0%. Considering both urinary parameters   demonstrated a slightly higher sensitivity (92.9%) with lower specificity  (77.6%). ROC analysis revealed a threshold of 215 microg/l for chromogranin A  with rather low sensitivity (73.9%) and specificity (74.2%). A weak positive  correlation was found between the tumor size of pheochromocytomas and plasma  metanephrine (r = 0.53, p </= 0.05) as well as chromogranin A (r = 0.60, p </=  0.01). In conclusion, plasma free and urinary metanephrines measured by enzyme  immunoassays are convenient and reliable parameters for the diagnosis of  pheochromocytoma. In contrast, CgA demonstrated poor sensitivity and specificity."|"sensitivity,plasma,pheochromocytomas,metanephrines,specificity"|"plasma,sensitivity,specificity,chromogranin,metanephrines" 
"AB  - Studies in mice suggest that the elastin microfibril interfacer-1 gene (EMILIN1),  the gene encoding elastin microfibril interfacer-1 protein, contributes to the  pathogenesis of essential hypertension (EH) in humans. EMILIN1 in part maintains   elastic fibres in vessel walls, and hence peripheral arterial compliance. In a  case-control study, we assessed 942 non-obese non-diabetic Chinese, comprising  467 patients with EH and 475 normotensive control subjects (166 without, and 309   with, family history of hypertension in first-degree relatives (FHH)).  Hypertension in first-degree relatives occurred in 88%, 65% and 0% of cases, all   controls and controls without FHH, respectively. We scanned for single-nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyped them in the EMILIN1 gene using high-resolution  melt-curve analysis. No exonic variants were detected. We assessed the  association of SNPs and their haplotypes with EH. Three SNPs in introns 1 and 5  (rs2289360, rs2011616 and rs7424556) were in strong pair-wise linkage  disequilibrium (r(2)>0.89). All three SNPs were significantly associated with  hypertension. Genotypic frequencies at the three SNPs differed significantly  between cases and only those controls without FHH. Healthy controls with FHH  should be excluded to increase the odds of detecting association. All the G  alleles of rs2289360 (odds ratio = 1.69, P = 0.010), rs2011616 (odds ratio =  1.52, P = 0.038) and rs7424556 (odds ratio = 1.59, P = 0.023) were high-risk  alleles in the recessive genetic model. We observed significant overall  haplotypic association with EH (empirical P = 0.0072); GGG is a risk haplotype (P  = 0.043). The overall results support EMILIN1 as a candidate gene for human EH."|"snps,eh,emilin1,hypertension,gene"|"eh,snps,controls,emilin1,fhh" 
"AB  - BACKGROUND: Telmisartan and atenolol are widely used in the management of  essential hypertension. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of these  two drugs in management of patients of essential hypertension. METHODS: Diagnosed  patients of essential hypertension were selected. Therapeutic option  (telmisartan/atenolol) was allocated to the patients by lottery method and they  were divided into two groups. The patients were followed on subsequent visits (4   in total) and their sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded.  RESULTS: Total number of 180 patients were divided into two treatment groups  (i.e., telmisaran and atenolol). Forty percent were male and 60% were female.  Majority of the patients were of age group 56-75 years. Telmisartan reduced  systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly compared to atenolol at the  end of 8 weeks of treatment (p = 0.000 and 0.016 respectively). CONCLUSION:  Telmisartan 80 mg once daily is more effective than atenolol 50 mg once daily in   lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the end of 8 weeks of  treatment."|"patients,atenolol,telmisartan,blood,systolic"|"patients,atenolol,telmisartan,blood,diastolic" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between serum total testosterone (TT) and  24-hour urinary sodium excretion in newly diagnosed stage 1 essential  hypertensive patients with normal renal function. STUDY DESIGN: In total, 80  never-treated stage 1 hypertensive patients were included. All patients provided   medical history and underwent physical examination, blood pressure measurement,  12-lead electrocardiography, routine urine analysis, biochemical analysis,  24-hour urine collection to measure urinary sodium and protein excretion, and  creatinine clearance calculation. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis revealed   that logarithmically converted 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was correlated  with age (r=-0.399, p<0.0001), body mass index, (r=0.304, p=0.006), systolic  blood pressure (r=0.394, p<0.0001), serum potassium (r=0.233, p=0.037),  creatinine clearance (r=0.600, p<0.0001), and logarithmically converted serum TT   (r=-0.272, p=0.015). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that age  (p<0.0001), creatinine clearance (p=0.015), systolic blood pressure (p<0.0001),  potassium (p=0.021), and serum TT (p=0.002) were independently related to  logarithmically converted 24-hour sodium excretion. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated  that serum TT levels were independently related to 24-hour urinary sodium amount."|"hour,sodium,analysis,serum,urinary"|"0001,24,hour,serum,sodium" 
"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between ten single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)  alpha/delta/gamma and essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: Participants were  recruited within the framework of a cohort populations survey from the PMMJS  (Prevention of Multiple Metabolic Disorders and MS in Jiangsu Province) which was  conducted in the urban community of Jiangsu province from 1999 to 2007. Eight  hundred and twenty subjects (551 non-hypertensive subjects, 269 hypertensive  subjects) were randomly selected but were not related to each other. Ten SNP  (rs135539, rs1800206, rs4253778 of PPARalpha; rs2016520, rs9794 of PPARdelta;  rs10865710, rs1805192, rs4684847, rs709158 and rs3856806 of PPARgamma) were  selected from the HapMap database. chi(2) test was used to determine whether the   whole population was in H-W genetic equilibrium. SHEsis software was used to  examine the relations of SNP and linkage equilibrium. Logistic regression model  was used to examine the association between ten SNP in the PPAR and EH. RESULTS:   Difference on the distribution of four SNP genotypes including rs1800206, rs9794,  rs10865710 and rs4684847 between high blood pressure and non-high blood pressure   group, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and normal SBP group, high diastolic  blood pressure (DBP) and normal DBP group was significant (P < 0.05). After  adjusting factors as age, sex, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, high  density lipoprotein cholesterol-C, high-fat diet and compared with wild-type gene  carriers, the OR (95%CI) of objects with rs1800206 V allele appeared in high  blood pressure, high SBP and high DBP were 0.60 (0.41 - 0.89), 0.57 (0.37 - 0.88)  and 0.61 (0.39 - 0.96), respectively. The OR (95%CI) of objects with G allele of   rs9794 were 0.63 (0.46 - 0.87), 0.51 (0.36 - 0.73) and 0.68 (0.47 - 1.01). The OR  (95%CI) of objects with G allele of rs10865710 were 1.62 (1.19 - 2.20), 1.59  (1.14 - 2.22) and 1.53 (1.07 - 2.18), respectively. While the OR (95%CI) of  objects with rs4684847 T allele were 1.42 (1.04 - 1.94), 1.38 (1.03 - 1.92) and  1.37 (1.00 - 1.88), respectively. CONCLUSION: The four SNPs including rs1800206  of PPARalpha, rs9794 of PPARdelta and rs4684847, rs10865710 of PPARgamma  influenced high blood pressure, high SBP and high DBP to different degrees."|"high,snp,rs1800206,used,ten"|"high,blood,pressure,snp,95" 
"AB  - Essential hypertension affects 75% of post-menopausal women in the United States   causing greater cardiovascular complications compared with age-matched men and  pre-menopausal women. Hormone replacement and current anti-hypertensive therapies  do not correct this post-menopausal increased risk suggesting a distinct  pathogenic framework. We investigated the hypothesis that distinct genetic  determinants might underlie susceptibility to salt sensitive hypertension in  pre-menopausal and post-menopausal states. To determine whether distinct genetic   loci contribute to post-menopausal salt-sensitive hypertension, we performed a  genome-wide scan for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting blood pressure (BP)  in 16-month old post-menopausal F2 (Dahl SxR)-intercross female rats  characterized for blood pressure by radiotelemetry. Given identical environments   and high salt challenge, post-menopausal BP levels were significantly higher than  observed in pre-menopausal (post-menopausal versus pre-menopausal SBP, P<0.0001)   and ovariectomized (post-menopausal versus ovariectomized SBP, P<0.001)  F2-intercross female rats. We detected four significant to highly significant  BP-QTLs (BP-pm1 on chromosome 13, LOD 3.78; BP-pm2 on chromosome 11, LOD 2.76;  BP-pm3 on chromosome 2, LOD 2.61; BP-pm4 on chromosome 4, LOD 2.50) and two  suggestive BP-QTLs (BP-pm5 on chromosome 15, LOD 2.37; BP-f1 on chromosome 5, LOD  1.65), four of which (BP-pm2, BP-pm3, BP-pm4, BP-pm5) were unique to this  post-menopausal cohort. These data demonstrate distinct polygenic susceptibility   underlying post-menopausal salt-sensitive hypertension providing a pathway  towards the identification of mechanism-based therapy for post-menopausal  hypertension and ensuing target-organ complications."|"menopausal,post,bp,distinct,hypertension"|"menopausal,bp,post,chromosome,lod"
